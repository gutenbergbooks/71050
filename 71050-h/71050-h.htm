<em>My dear Cornelia:</em></p>
</div>

<p><em>You and I have discovered many little differences of
opinion; but we have always had so much in common, so
many tastes and quite elementary convictions, that, years
and years ago, I tried to persuade you that we ought to
take a stand together. On that point we failed to reach an
agreement; and which of us was right is a question that
you have never since been willing to debate with me.</em></p>

<p><em>There is another point, however, which I have long desired
to discuss with you: that is our common liking for
dedicated things. I wish to dedicate this little book to you—my
share in it. The task embarrasses me; for, wherever in
these pages I find anything that seems to me blithe or
charming or wise, instantly I recognize that it is not mine
but yours. Here then, in justice, I restore to you these
feebly recorded memories of our walks and talks in sunlight
and moonlight.</em></p>

<p><em>While I am confessing, I will tell you what perhaps I
haven’t mentioned before, that it was Mr. M. A. De
Wolfe Howe who urged me to draw you into our conversation
on religion. And I really ought to mention Mr.
Ellery Sedgwick; but, the fact is, I have been just a bit
jealous of him since he sent that telegram—I showed it to
you, did I not?—shortly after he made your acquaintance,
saying, “I am desperately in love with Cornelia.”</em></p>

<p><em>Of course I don’t mind your being admired, afar off,
by anyone who pleases, no matter how dangerous he may
be at close range; but this page, you must understand,
exists only to record that I am</em></p>

WE DISCUSS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
PARENTS AND CRITICS</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">When I am in doubt, I talk with Cornelia; and
while I am with her, my uncertainties disappear.
But this subject she herself broached, at her home
in one of those paradises of wood and water where
Americans of her class have learned to hide their
lives—for the summer.</p>

<p>She is a young woman of forty-five, with what
Hazlitt somewhere calls a “coronet face,” finely
cut and proudly borne, and it gives one a feeling
of distinction merely to be in her presence. My
memory holds like a piece of radiant sculpture
the image that she left there at her wedding,
twenty years ago, when she turned at the altar
after the episcopal benediction and paced down
the aisle, clear-eyed and fearless, to the thunder
of organ music: it seemed to me then that the
young chevalier of the diplomatic service on whose
arm her hand had alighted was leading the
Samothracian Victory into the holy state of
matrimony. It was an excellent alliance, with high
sanctions and distinguished witnesses, auspiciously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
begun and with a constantly felicitous continuation.
She has walked ever since, so her friends
declare, between purple ribbons: her ways have
gone smoothly and well in delectable regions far
above the level of the rank-scented multitude.</p>

<p>When one talks with her, her hands lie still in
her lap. She does not think with her hands, nor
does any other emphasis of her body intrude its
comment upon the serene and assured movements
of her intelligence. So remote she seems from the
ignominious and infamous aspects of existence,
that one wonders how she becomes aware of them.
Yet such unpleasant things, verminous or reptilian,
as creep within range of her vision she inspects
sharply and with intrepidity; for she knows
precisely how to deal with them.</p>

<p>As I sat there, blissfully receiving a sense of the
security and perfection which emanate from her,
it just flickered into my consciousness that, if a
mouse could have entered that impeccably ordered
room, she would not for a moment have been at a
loss. She would quietly have summoned a maid.
Then she would have said: “There is a mouse in
the room. Take it out.” She likes everything to
be right; and she knows so absolutely what is
right, that any shade of uncertainty in conversation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span>
with her seems a kind of baseness and disloyalty.
Yet, as much as a superior being can be
troubled, she was troubled about the state of
current fiction. She was troubled in that high and
spirited sense of responsibility which certain fine
women feel for the tone of the Republic.</p>

<p>“You have shown,” she said, “some understanding
of the immense influence exerted by
literature upon the minds of our young people.
But your discussion of ‘unprintable’ books is up
in the air. You must meet peril definitely, perilously,
or your readers won’t even believe that it
exists. In a prairie fire, you must fight with fire;
water, the flames snuff up like a perfume, and
sweep on. You don’t come to grips with the facts.
You asperse them with rosewater.”</p>

<p>“You mean,” I replied, fencing feebly, “that
I did not furnish a guide to those new books which
no young person should read? I had thought that
would rather please you. The suppressive societies
will supply the information which I omitted.
I am not specially interested in the circulation of
any questionable books—except my own.”</p>

<p>“Your innuendo is nasty and your tone is
flippant,” she said. I bowed in acknowledgment
of my entire agreement. “But the subject,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
continued, “is grave. It is very grave to those of
us who have boys and girls of eighteen and twenty.
We wish them in these formative years to be subject
only to the finest influences. How can they
be, when they read such books? How can any
one who is interested in moulding the characters
of the younger generation not desire to keep such
books as you know they are reading out of their
hands? When I think of my son or my daughter,
with their clean sweet young minds, wading into
the filth of our popular fiction, I repeat to myself
those lines of Heine—you remember:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container fs90">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">‘Mir ist, als ob ich die Hände</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">Aufs Haupt dir legen sollt,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Betend dass Gott dich erhalte</div>
    <div class="verse indent3">So rein und schön und hold.’”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Try it,” I suggested with studious brutality.
“Call in the children. Lay your hands on their
heads, and pray that God may keep them in their
beauty and purity and sweetness. How will they
take it? Demurely, I fancy—while they are in
your presence. But when they meet in the garden
afterward, they will exclaim, ‘Isn’t mother an old
dear!’ And then they will laugh softly, and think
of—all sorts of things. Heine’s prayer, you
know, doesn’t hit off the aspirations of contemporary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
youth. Beauty is still ‘all right.’ But the
quality of ‘sweetness,’ though it is not yet wholly
unmarketable, is held in greatly diminished esteem.
And as for purity—‘What is purity?’ asks the
jesting younger generation, and will not stay for
an answer.”</p>

<p>“Young people ask many foolish questions,”
said Cornelia dismissively. “What troubles me is
rather the changing attitude of so many parents
and teachers. Have they lost that beautiful desire
to shield the years of innocence? Have they quite
lost their sense of responsibility?”</p>

<p>“No,” I conjectured, “they haven’t altogether
lost their sense of responsibility. But they haven’t
known quite what to do with it; and just now it
seems temporarily to have slipped from their hands.
They didn’t know how to use it when they had it;
or they were afraid to use it, and cast the responsibility
for the innocence of their children upon
God; and now the children, sick of that evasion,
are acting for themselves. And I am afraid that
we have rather lost contact with the younger
generation. It has experienced so much, it has
read so much, it is so accustomed to the free
discussion of all sorts of topics which we thought
ominous even to mention—that I often suspect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
we have more to learn from it than it has to learn
from us.”</p>

<p>“That is a false and vicious humility.”</p>

<p>“No, I assure you, very genuine, however
vicious. It came over me in the spring several
years ago in a vision. I happened one day to observe
in my garden a large white cat stalking with
soft experienced tread under the lilacs, on the lookout
for young robins making their trial flight.
Being of a somewhat analogical turn of mind, and
having then a high conceit of the wisdom of our
generation, I said to myself: ‘The garden is a
symbol of the world. The wise cat is the old professor.
The fledgling robin is the young student.’
As I murmured the last word, the white cat made
a flying leap for the nestling. It proved to be, however,
an adult wren, pert and elusive, which hopped
just one spray higher and twittered derision. The
cat walked off crestfallen, muttering: ‘Such wise
birds! I have never known a season when birds
were wise so young.’”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, I really trust these ‘wise birds’ nowadays
much further than you do.”</p>

<p>“Won’t you explain why?” said Cornelia.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you another story. At a neighborhood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
party recently, where there was dancing,
and the very youngest generation was present, I
was greatly flattered by receiving from Adelaide,
a young lady of five years, marked attentions
which on previous occasions had been directed to
Bertram, a far more plausible person than I in all
respects, and, moreover, only thrice the age of
Adelaide. I said, ‘I thought you were devoted to
Bertram.’ Instantly she replied: ‘I was. But I am
not interested in Bertram any longer. I know
all about him.’ At the age of five, don’t you see,
she has already begun to ‘sip the foam of many
lives.’ I happened to be, shall I say, the coca-cola
of the evening. But I know that I shall be sipped
and discarded. Already Adelaide has become
critical, fastidious, wary; she will not for long be
taken in.”</p>

<p>“Well?” again from Cornelia, with a hint of
irritation.</p>

<p>“I mean to insist,” I explained cautiously,
“that such sentimentalists as you and I seldom
do justice to the hard, clear-eyed maturity—of
a sort—which our young people have attained
by pooh-poohing our sentimentality and subjectivity
and adopting what Santayana calls a simple
‘animal faith’ in the material surfaces of things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<p>“Just what do you mean?” Cornelia inquired,—sharply
and scornfully,—“by ‘hard, clear-eyed
maturity’? I have no such feeling about my
own children. My own son and daughter are being
brought up as I was brought up. Well-bred young
people to-day differ in no essential respect from
well-bred people twenty years ago. What some
idiots try to make us believe is a change of standards
is not a change of standards. It is merely
a horrid confusion, due to the fact that a great
many ill-bred people are expressing themselves.”</p>

<p>“That in itself,” I said, “implies a change in
conditions, if not in standards. There is, as you
say, a ‘horrid confusion.’ The confusion is due
to the fact that the well-bred young people are
now applauding the ill-bred old people. That is
really significant. When the well-bred young
people begin to desert, it is all up with the Old
Guard. That indicates either a revolt or a revolution.
You must remember, Cornelia, that one
half of history is an account of the struggle made
by your class to keep the rest out; and the other
half of history is an account of how the rest are
getting in. If you are now in the presence of a
revolt by a weak body of outsiders, you may
still effectively oppose it. But if it is a revolution<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
including your own household, you had better
prepare to support the best elements in the <em>de
facto</em> government—in the literary no less than
in the political republic.”</p>

<p>“There are no best elements,” Cornelia retorted,
“in what you call the <em>de facto</em> government.
There are no good elements. There are no decent
elements. It is an insurrection of hoodlum and
bedlam. It is all vile. The situation,” she continued,
with the clear precision of a cookie-cutter,
“demands drastic action. You, instead
of strengthening the hands of those who attempt
to act, amuse yourself with philosophical futilities,
and virtually throw the weight of your levity
against all action.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I desire an antecedent action of the
mind?”</p>

<p>“But you are so ambiguous that you have no
force. One can’t really tell on which side you are.”</p>

<p>“I should like,” I hurriedly replied, “to be on
the side of the angels. You know that I should
like to be on your side. If I am ever driven from
your side, it will be by the fine high-bred incuriosity
of angels. It will be by the applause of angels,
accompanied by some fresh demonstration
of their immitigable hostility to thought.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span></p>

<p>“You are rude.”</p>

<p>“And you—just faintly provoking. I am not
sure, Cornelia, that you quite understand the
limits of a writer’s power. I have a friend, long
experienced in a public library, who assures me
that critical articles have no real effect. Readers
either agree with them from the outset and are
pleased, or disagree with them from the outset
and are displeased. This, she tells me, is especially
true of lawyers, clergymen, professors, and all
nice people. Perhaps that is so. Let us suppose
that it is. Suppose also that I were returning to
the discussion of ‘unprintable’ books. What
treatment of the subject would please <em>you</em>? You
are a ‘conservative’ of definite convictions, and
you demand drastic action. Exactly what is the
situation and what the appropriate action? Are
you prepared to say?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” she replied. “And I will tell you
also the stand which I believe should be taken by
a critic who professes to have the public welfare
at heart.”</p>

<p>“Before you do that,” I interposed, “you must
pardon me one more flippancy. Isn’t it true that
people often ‘take a stand’ to watch something
that is going on and that will continue to go on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
whether they remain in their ‘stand’ or not?”</p>

<p>“If you mean to ask whether I am a moral
futilitarian, I am not. People of character take
a stand in order to prevent obnoxious things from
going on. If the obnoxious things continue to go
on in spite of them, people of character are glad
to be left behind, or even to be trampled underfoot,
when that is the only way to make their
protest effective.”</p>

<p>“You speak like yourself, Cornelia,” I said,
“and no higher compliment is possible. Your
image interests me. I seem to see an invading
army with leveled spears, and you dauntlessly
flinging yourself upon them. Opposition interests
me as long as it is effective—as long as the opposing
breast checks the leveled spears. Sniping
from the housetop at the postman, after the revolution
has actually taken place—in that, there
is a kind of unpalatable futility. But how do you
apply your figure to the duty of the critic in the
face of current fiction?”</p>

<p>“I apply it in this way. You yourself have admitted
that it would be very easy to make a list
of popular writers who, however varied their art
and method, have running through their work
an insistent preoccupation with sex of quite a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
different character from its occasional romantic
treatment in the novels that you and I were
brought up on. The heart of the matter is this:
the minds of young people are being gravely
affected by a group of writers who, in their
several ways, definitely challenge the idea of
chastity. Now, what a really serious critic should
do is to call a halt in the production and reading
of that sort of literature.”</p>

<p>“My dear Cornelia,” I exclaimed,—I always
exclaim “My dear” when I am about to express
impatience; it introduces the note of suavity,—“My
dear Cornelia, do you read the magazines?
Do you attend church? Do you see the newspapers?
Did you not observe that the form, ‘It
is time to call a halt,’ was first employed on the
tenth of August, 1914, by an editor in Oshkosh
with reference to the German advance on Paris?
In the following week it was applied by a clergyman
of Tulsa, Oklahoma, with reference to the
consumption of chewing-gum in the United States.
Since that time, it has been in continuous employment
by all serious critics, lay and clerical, with
reference to the output of the leading English and
American novelists.”</p>

<p>“Well,” she replied, “what if it has? So much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
the worse for the leading English and American
novelists. If they are all running amuck, is that
any reason why the rest of us should lose our
heads? If the novelists are going definitely wrong
at the point which I have indicated, a critic could
not be better employed than in standing at that
point and calling a halt.”</p>

<p>“You assign to criticism,” I said, “a task which
appeals but faintly to the critic—a task like that
of a traffic policeman without authority or power.
If I had all the authority in the world, I would
not cry ‘stop’ to the novelists, even to those that
I have criticized most harshly.”</p>

<p>“And why not?”</p>

<p>“Because I learn too much from what they are
doing to desire to dam the stream of information.
The realistic novelists to-day are extraordinarily
copious, candid, and illuminating confessors of
private morals. I have, to be sure, been troubled
by the fact that the lives of respectable people are
so seldom revealed in these confessions. I have
even allowed myself to wonder faintly at times
whether unwillingness to confess may not be, as
our direful Mid-Western school contends, the
chief distinction between respectable people and
the other sort. It is a horrid doubt, concerning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
which no one but the novelist betrays much curiosity
or provides much light. And so, for novelists,
I wish freedom to confess, and, for myself,
freedom to comment on their confessions—though,
since they have become so desperately
confessive, it seems frequently indelicate to do
so. If they are, as you assert, definitely challenging
the idea of chastity, the matter is indeed of
more than merely literary interest. I should like
to know whether our standards are undergoing
revolutionary change. Won’t you please go out
and ‘call a halt,’ while I go home and inquire in
my own fashion whether anything is going on;
whether the idea of chastity has actually been
challenged; if so, what idea of chastity, why,
where, when, in what manner, and with what
results?”</p>

<p>“You are hopeless,” said Cornelia, rising. “I
shall ask the Bishop to make this the subject of
one of his Lenten discourses.”</p>

<p>“That will be just the thing,” I rejoined, “to
induce profound reflection in our novelists.”</p>

I MEDITATE, IN FRONT OF A BOOKCASE,<br>
ON SCOTT, JANE AUSTEN, CHARLOTTE<br>
BRONTË, AND THE GOOD VICTORIANS</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">When I returned to my study, I dropped into
a chair which frequently invites meditation, before
a case containing current fiction. My eyes
glanced swiftly along the rows of Wells, Galsworthy,
Bennett, Beresford, and Walpole, lingering
an extra moment on <em>Ann Veronica</em>, <em>The Dark
Flower</em>, and <em>The Pretty Lady</em>; visited with slow
interrogative scrutiny the “colorful” assemblage
of Hergesheimer, D. H. Lawrence, Rebecca West,
May Sinclair, W. L. George, James Joyce, Cabell,
Sinclair Lewis, Sherwood Anderson, Charles G.
Norris, Ben Hecht, and Waldo Franck; then
fluttered to rest upon a half-dozen miscellaneous
recent arrivals—Meredith Nicholson’s <em>Broken
Barriers</em>, Mrs. Gerould’s <em>Conquistador</em>, Maxwell’s
<em>Spinster of This Parish</em>, Willa Cather’s <em>The Lost
Lady</em>, G. F. Hummel’s <em>After All</em>, and <em>West of
the Water Tower</em>.</p>

<p>Here, I said to myself, is material enough to
prove Cornelia’s case, if she has a case. Among<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
this company I shall find the challengers, if there
is a challenge. What are they calling in question?
The idea of chastity—whose idea of chastity?
Cornelia’s idea, the idea of all nice people—What
is the idea of all nice people regarding
chastity? Look in the Dictionary, the record of
good usage—Here it is: “Innocence of unlawful
sexual intercourse.” As a history of usage, the
Dictionary should add in parenthesis: “This is a
virtue assumed to be present in all members of
the female sex in good and regular standing.”</p>

<p>Here we have a simple and definite idea to work
upon: Chastity is a virtue assumed to be present in
all members of the female sex in good and regular
standing. Who first gave currency to that idea?
Our friends the Victorians? Oh, no! It is astonishing
how many so-called Victorian ideas, delicate
and fragile, can be found thriving in manlier ages,
in old robust books like <em>Don Juan</em> and <em>Tom Jones</em>,
and in the drama of that “den of lions,” the
Renaissance. How they valued this virtue—those
“lions” of the Renaissance! How they
valued this virtue in their wives! What praise
they had for its possessors—“chaste as the icicle
that’s curded by the frost from purest snow and
hangs on Dian’s temple”! Shakespeare valiantly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
assumed the presence of that virtue in all
members of the female sex in good and regular
standing—except Cleopatra.</p>

<p>But we must not be too historical. The idea of
chastity exists full-blown in Goldsmith, in those
two famous stanzas which inquire what happens
when lovely woman stoops to “folly” and learns
too late that men “betray,” that is, fail to legalize
the “folly.” We remember what follows, for the
lines were in every anthology employed in our
formative period to give to our young minds a
relish for virtue and a lively apprehension of the
consequences of departing from it. Cornelia still
thinks we should prescribe Goldsmith rather than
Mr. Galsworthy for the collateral reading of her
daughter. Goldsmith declares very firmly that
when lovely woman stoops to folly, no art can
wash her guilt away.</p>

<div class="poetry-container fs90">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">The only art her guilt to cover,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">To hide her shame from every eye,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To give repentance to her lover,</div>
    <div class="verse indent2">And wring his bosom—is to die.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Several distinct elements appear in our fully
developed idea: first, chastity is the virtue of a
legal status; second, women are naturally law-abiding;
third, if they lose their status, it is by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
the natural perfidy of predatory man; fourth, the
disaster is irretrievable. There is no salvation for
the woman but death, the cloister, exile, or, occasionally,
a shamefaced return to “chastity”
under the horsewhip or at point of the pistol.</p>

<p>This idea flourished in the “good old” novels of
Sir Walter Scott; it is fairly well illustrated in the
case of Effie Deans in <em>The Heart of Midlothian</em>.
Scott was a romancer. His contemporary, Jane
Austen, was a realist. She was far less chivalrously
certain than he that lovely women who
are neglectful of legal status are by nature virtuous.
She looked at them hard; she inclined
strongly to believe that such women are by nature
vain, sentimental, and ignorant—like Lydia
Bennett in <em>Pride and Prejudice</em>. But Jane Austen
is at one with Scott in treating unlawful passion
austerely. In the fiction of both these worthies
the erring woman is unmistakably a “victim”;
the man, however plausible his manners, is a
profligate and unprincipled, if not a designing,
villain; the consequences of departure from legal
status are depicted in strongly deterrent colors.
Our idea of chastity is fortified by them.</p>

<p>Now let us advance a generation or so and question
our friends the Victorians: do they accept<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
our idea and loyally enforce it? Yes—now and
then. Familiar cases? There is the case of little
Em’ly in <em>David Copperfield</em>. She is the typical
victim of the typical seducer; and Dickens punishes
them both in approved traditional fashion.
He drowns the wicked lover—which is, of course,
a logical consequence of departure from legal
status. He sends the victim with her “soft
sorrowful blue eyes” to Australia, where she
attempts to expiate her guilt by a life of self-sacrifice.
She has many a good offer of marriage;
“‘But, uncle,’ she says to me, ‘that’s gone for
ever.’” Here we have the doctrine of the irretrievable.
That doctrine is sternly proclaimed by
George Eliot in the graver case of Hetty Sorrel in
<em>Adam Bede</em>. The repentant lover tries to do something
for Hetty. His last words are that it is no
use: “You told me the truth when you said to
me once, ‘There’s a sort of wrong that can never
be made up for.’” Neither Scott nor Jane Austen
could have handled these elementary cases in a
more strictly orthodox fashion. Our idea is again
fortified.</p>

<p>But the great Victorian novelists pushed their
speculations beyond the elementary problems
raised by the victim-villain situation. They had,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
several of them, personal reasons for reflecting
thoughtfully upon the social utility of the stout
bulwarks with which the English law attempted
to fortify the idea of chastity and the related
doctrine of the irretrievable. Dickens is said to
have fallen in love with all the Hogarth daughters
and to have married the wrong one. Thackeray
married at twenty-five a woman who half a dozen
years later became insane and who outlived him.
Bulwer-Lytton was legally separated at twenty-three
from a woman who outlived him. Meredith’s
<em>Modern Love</em> discusses an incompatibility
of temper from which a death divorced him. And
George Eliot, high priestess of Victorian morality,
was actually living in a kind of solemn and almost
officious virtue with another woman’s husband.
These were circumstances arranged to liberate
speculation and to set it playing a little skeptically
about the one way out—the sole dark exit
which Goldsmith had so glibly offered to lovely
women who are unfortunate in love.</p>

<p>In a novel of the mid-nineteenth century, which
used to be thought very dangerous reading,—<em>Jane
Eyre</em>,—Charlotte Brontë considered one of
these more difficult cases, and almost presented
it. Jane, an eager, self-reliant, self-supporting, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>
fairly hard-headed young woman, first of our
modern heroines, is loved with a grand passion
by Rochester, who is enchained by marriage to
a hopeless lunatic. Now the novelist permits Jane
to fall deeply in love with Rochester, thus perilously
illustrating the possibility that a truly great
and two-sided passion may come into existence
outside legal status. Charlotte Brontë, however,
intervened twice to save the situation. She
wasn’t fastidious about the chastity of Rochester:
chastity is a female virtue. But she was
fastidious about the chastity of Jane. And so,
of course, she makes Jane ignorant at first of the
fact that Rochester is married; and she makes
Jane tell him that it is all up, when she learns that
he is married. That was the perfectly correct
thing for Jane to do.</p>

<p>But it created a dilemma. Charlotte Brontë
knew that it created a dilemma—a dilemma with
unchastity for one horn and the frustration of a
grand passion for the other. (It should perhaps
be explained that a grand passion, in those illiberal
days, was thought of as an experience that befell
a girl but once in a lifetime.) Charlotte Brontë
did not quite dare to treat this dilemma. She
faced it for a moment. She let her readers face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
it for a moment. Then she intervened again: she
destroyed the dilemma. She made it all come
right. She restored both hero and heroine to
chastity by pitching the lunatic wife headlong
into the flames of the house of Rochester.</p>

<p>A happy thought—so it must have seemed to
the author. Yet, as one reflects upon it, this solution
appears a little dangerous. To pitch a superfluous
wife into the flames—well, it would not
quite serve as a Kantian basis for the solution of
all such problems. Under the English law, the
dilemma reasserted its actuality. <em>Jane Eyre</em>
stands there early in the Victorian Age as a challenge,
rather evasively presented, to the idea of
chastity. In W. B. Maxwell’s <em>Spinster of This
Parish</em>, 1923, a modern heroine is placed in almost
precisely Jane’s situation, except that her lover
does not think it necessary to lie to her about his
lunatic wife. Without a moment’s hesitation, she
accepts the grand passion. Since she accepts it
with all the fortitude and fidelity of an old-fashioned
wife, she seems to-day a quite safe,
old-fashioned character; and it is hard to conceive
of any one’s thinking of her as “unchaste.”</p>

<p>Other Victorians, usually with much circumspection,
returned to the dilemma; and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
returned to it in such numbers that to challenge
the idea of chastity as a legal creation may be
regarded as a rather distinctively Victorian contribution.
From the question what to do when
you are united to an undivorceable insane wife,
the Victorians proceeded cautiously to consider
the demands of virtue in analogous sets of circumstances.
What is the point at which the
maintenance of legal chastity involves the loss of
ethical integrity? What is right conduct for a
young girl whose parents or relatives have united
her in a “suitable marriage” to a repellent brute
of means and good family? That is a question
which interested Thackeray in <em>The Newcomes</em>; and
it will be remembered that the wife of Barnes
Newcome answers the question in her own case by
giving her husband occasion for divorce under the
English law. It is not always observed that to
Hester Prynne in <em>The Scarlet Letter</em> right conduct,
to the last page of the book, consists in fidelity
to her lover, not to her fanatical husband; and
Hawthorne, perhaps indecently, places the lovers
in adjacent graves of a Boston burying-ground.
Isabel Archer, in Henry James’s <em>Portrait of a Lady</em>,
is begged by her lover to desert her husband and
come to him, and to disregard the “bottomless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
idiocy” of what other people will think or say
about them. Though, on the last page, Isabel is
still clinging to legality, one is left in some doubt
whether she will cling indefinitely. Meredith’s
Diana is a standing challenge to the doctrine of
irretrievable marriage. Hardy’s Tess is a defiance
to the idea of chastity entertained by the Angel
Clares; and the obscene relation in <em>Jude the
Obscure</em> is obviously that between him and his
wife, not that between him and Sue, except as it
is smirched by his return to his wife and by her
return to her husband.</p>

<p>But why multiply instances? Here are enough
to show that the good Victorians repeatedly solicited
our sympathy and our support for heroines
whose ethical integrity was afflicted by their legal
chastity. The idea of illicit love as an affair of
victim and villain, has been largely jettisoned or
given over to melodrama, as of an interest too
primitive or too banal for extended consideration.
To their successors, the Victorian realists bequeath,
as matter of far higher artistic and general
human concern, their rather cautious essays
upon the evaded dilemma of <em>Jane Eyre</em>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III-2">III<br>
H. G. WELLS, GALSWORTHY, MAY SINCLAIR,
J. D. BERESFORD</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Let us now enter fearfully upon the burning
ground of contemporary fiction. The territory is
immense, and unexplorable here in detail. All
that one can do is to stand upon the smoky
borderland, and comment briefly upon some conspicuous
spots in the conflagrant area and upon
the general direction of the wind.</p>

<p>One cannot, on every occasion for mentioning
him, reread the entire works of Mr. Wells. I
retain a strong impression that most of his novels
of contemporary life challenge the idea of indissoluble
marriage. In this respect Mr. Wells is no
innovator. I retain also the impression that one
tends to derive from these novels a conviction
that everyone’s first marriage is a mistake. This
indicates the direction of the wind. Now Mr.
Wells is a long way from accepting Goldsmith’s
idea that death is the only way out of a bad situation.
He has no patience with the doctrine of
irretrievability. But as long as unlawful relations
furnish the only available alternative way out, his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span>
works naturally disquiet Cornelia, and challenge
her idea of chastity.</p>

<p>His works disquiet me, because I think the
defect which his heroes and heroines find in their
first marriage they will find also in their second,
and their third, and their fourth; they will find
that neither the second nor the third nor the
fourth marriage is capable of sustaining indefinitely
the sense of ecstasy which the tired business
man experiences the first time he notices how
pretty his stenographer is. Tedium is three fourths
of life. Sensible men settle quietly down to endure
it, sustained by their fortitude and their twenty-five
per cent of creature comforts and incidentals.
The others imagine that by Babbittian adventures
they can change the proportions and get something
better than tedium. There is nothing that
is even “just as good.” Thackeray knew this and
admitted it. Mr. Wells hasn’t admitted it. That
constitutes one distinction between the author
of <em>The Newcomes</em> and the author of <em>The New
Machiavelli</em>.</p>

<p>Mr. Galsworthy told us in <em>The Dark Flower</em>
about the quest of ecstasy, and in <em>Saint’s Progress</em>
he confessed something of the extraordinary
disregard of legality in sexual relations on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
part of well-bred young people, occasioned in part
by the stresses of the war. Mr. Galsworthy, like
Mr. Wells, inclines to make ecstasy rather than
legality the test of right relations between men
and women, though I think most of his heroes and
heroines are somewhat less incorrigibly expectant
than those of Mr. Wells. In <em>The Forsyte Saga</em>, his
prime achievement and a rich and various and
notable work, he makes his most significant study
of that Victorian dilemma upon which <em>Jane Eyre</em>
was so nearly impaled. In the case of Soames
Forsyte and Irene and Jolyon, he brings, with
great circumstantiality and seriousness, a fine
woman face to face with the choice of illegal
status or the substantial frustration of life; and
Irene unequivocally accepts the illegal status.
The entire treatment of the theme indicates, I
think, Mr. Galsworthy’s belief that she was ethically
justified, as she was also justified by the general
consequences, in her union with Jolyon. The
one high crime in the book, as Mr. Galsworthy
conceives it, is Soames Forsyte’s exaction of
marital rights from a wife who is in love with
another man.</p>

<p>I wonder whether Cornelia has read <em>The Forsyte
Saga</em>. I wonder whether, if she should enter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
imaginatively into the circumstances, she would
not consider Soames’s act a crime. If so, she
would challenge the idea of chastity. Perhaps
she would call the act “a heinous unchastity”;
but that would be to abandon our definition.</p>

<p>I was a bit shocked last spring when someone
remarked that May Sinclair had joined the ranks
of those who are writing primarily to engage the
attention of Mr. Sumner; and that <em>Ann Severn
and the Fieldings</em> is an “immoral book.” I recalled
her <em>Divine Fire</em> as one of the keen delights
of twenty years ago, and I remembered her
recently published <em>Mr. Waddington of Wyck</em> as the
most exhilarating and remorseless flaying alive of
the philanderer that I had ever witnessed.</p>

<p>I read <em>Ann Severn and the Fieldings</em>, and I
found it, especially in its last two or three chapters,
a love story of poignant and thrilling beauty.
Compared with many of the physiologically and
pathologically introspective novels of the day it
is, despite its exhibition of a neurosis resulting in
false angina pectoris, almost an old-fashioned love
story. It is almost old-fashioned in presenting,
in the case of Ann, a passion as straight, as single,
as unswerving, as unflinching as that of Shakespeare’s
Juliet. Ann, brought up with the three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
Fielding brothers, loves one of them, Jerrold, from
childhood till the end, with the “divine fire.”
Jerrold, on leave from the front, intends to ask
Ann to be his wife; but by the connivance of circumstances
with the lying of interested persons,
he is persuaded that Ann is living with his shell-shocked
brother. Jerrold, thereupon, in the recklessness
of the hour, expecting to be killed in the
next attack, abruptly marries Maisie. When the
conspiracy of lying and ambiguous circumstances
is dispelled, Ann claims Jerrold as her own, and
he gives himself to her “without a scruple.”</p>

<p>Now the ethical points, as exhibited by the
author, are these: first, Jerrold has shown male
recklessness regarding his virtue, by marrying one
woman when he loved another; second, he displays
an awakened ethical sensitiveness when he
rejoices at the termination of his intimate relations
with his wife; third, Ann has never for an
instant swerved from her virtue; Maisie proves
her virtue in the beautiful, if impossible, scene in
which she surrenders her husband to Ann, saying:
“I can’t think of anything more disgusting
than to keep a man tied to you when he cares for
somebody else. I should feel as if I were living in
sin.” Of course the major contention is, that Ann,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
though without legal status, was “chaste”; but
that is a paradox and a challenge to our idea.</p>

<p>Let us take one more case in this group: Mr.
J. D. Beresford with the Jacob Stahl trilogy. In
this rather drab yet impressive work, one finds
the “emancipative” ideas of Mr. Wells assimilated
by a much less buoyant nature. Jacob
muddles into a bad marriage with an unquestionably
unsuitable person, from whom he separates,
though he is not divorced. He falls in love with
one of the keepers of his lodging-house and asks
her to live with him without legal sanction till his
wife shall die. After months of consideration she
freely and resolutely joins him. From that point,
Mr. Beresford exerts himself to prove that their
relation is just as grave and permanent and full
of labor and anxiety and humdrum and gray
days as marriage itself. I suspect there is a kind
of grim truthfulness in the relation of this adventure.
It reminds one, in the third volume, of
George Eliot and of accounts given by sundry
visitors of the slightly dreary decorum of her
ménage. There is no expectation of ecstasy on
the part of either of the adventurers. They merely
look, outside marriage, for the alleviations of the
ultimate human solitude afforded by a satisfactory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span>
marriage. They are tolerably successful.
But when the death of Stahl’s wife clears the way,
they return, for various reasons of expediency, to
a legal status.</p>

<p>Mr. Wells, Mr. Galsworthy, May Sinclair, and
Mr. Beresford are all, I think, seriously interested
in morality. On the whole, their work does not
contemptuously and explicitly challenge the idea
of monogamous marriage. At least, it does not
flout the possibility of arriving, by freedom of
readjustment, at some reasonably satisfactory and
permanent relationship between one man and one
woman. And so, in a sense, their point of view
begins to appear relatively conservative. If they
could be questioned regarding their moral purposes
or tendencies, they would profess sincere
respect for virtue. But they would add that they
are concerned, as novelists, with reflecting the
revision which the idea of virtue is undergoing
in our time. They are generally willing to admit
that society and the state are related in necessary
and vital ways to the customary form of sexual
alliance. But they repudiate the notion that
mere legality can set the seal of virtue upon any
such alliance. Less firmly, yet pretty clearly,
they repudiate the notion that mere illegality can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
remove the seal of virtue which individual adventurers
may set upon their alliance. Because
chastity has been traditionally identified with
legality, they hold the word in some contempt;
they incline to discard it as the name of any
recognizable virtue. The important ideas which
it has obscured are these: to maintain permanent
relations with one who is thoroughly agreeable to
you is virtue; to maintain permanent relations
with one who is thoroughly disagreeable to you
is vice.</p>

<p>There is quite a bit of ground between.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV-2">IV<br>
SEVEN REASONS FOR MR. HERGESHEIMER,
D. H. LAWRENCE, AND THE EMETIC SCHOOL</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Among the novelists who have arrived within
the last ten years, it is more difficult to discover
any community in constructive ethical intention
or tendency. One can no longer feel sure that
marriage is regarded as the normal condition, for
which fidelity in illegal relations is a substitute.
One recalls numerous heroines who collect erotic
adventures like female Don Juans, and others who
stoutly and “conscientiously” refuse marriage to
lovers to whom they refuse nothing else. And
here is George F. Hummel’s <em>After All</em>, advertised
as follows: “Its analysis of the inherent self-destructiveness
of marriage is carried to a conclusion
which, however opposed to accepted
standards of morality, has in it the logic and compelling
force of a thinking man’s profoundest conviction.”
Here are D. H. Lawrence’s Lost Girl
and Arnold Bennett’s Pretty Lady, and W. L.
George’s Ursula Trent, and Willa Cather’s Lost
Lady, and Joseph Hergesheimer’s Cytherea, and
the heroine of Mr. Masters’s <em>Domesday Book</em>—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
whole troop of damsels who meander where they
will in quest of rosebuds. Here is Robert Herrick’s
Lilla deliberately and successfully discarding
marriage for an unsanctioned union. Here is
Margaret Prescott Montague’s Julie (in <em>Deep
Channel</em>) finding in an illicit relationship the
effective key to a larger and more spiritual life.
Here is even Mrs. Gerould permitting a grave and
thoughtful illegal relationship to the hero of
<em>Conquistador</em>, whom she would apparently have
us regard as the very pink of essential purity.
No single explanation will account for the community
in “destructive” tendency discernible in
the latest phase of the movement; or for the fact
that there is hardly one in a dozen recent novels
which Cornelia would care to see in the hands of
her daughter; or for the more alarming fact that,
if there were one such novel in a dozen, Cornelia’s
daughter probably would not care to read it.</p>

<p>Since, in the United States, marriage has been
by no means a legally irretrievable disaster, it
would be absurd to point to the rigor of our law
as a very important occasion of the widespread
indifference or disrespect for chastity exhibited or
reflected by many American writers. The occasions
of our revolt lie deeper than that, and many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>
causes conspire to give to our current fiction
its unwonted aspect of levity and license.</p>

<p>First, as a literary inheritance, the Wells-Galsworthy
group of the elder novelists bequeathed
to their successors a profound skepticism about
the legal touchstone of chastity, together with a
pleasant rule of virtue which tends, as a social
regulation, to be unworkable, since it is incapable
of objective and public application. Their “rule,”
developed a little, lands one in an anarchical
moral individualism; and their successors developed
it by omitting the word “permanent” from
the definition of virtue.</p>

<p>Secondly, the appearance of a good many rather
frothily wanton pictures of frothily wanton
younger sets may still be attributed to reaction
from the austerities of war; the writers of the
futilitarian school take chastity lightly because
they take everything lightly: for examples, Mr.
Carl Van Vechten and Mr. F. Scott Fitzgerald—though
it must be admitted that the latter,
in <em>The Beautiful and Damned</em>, has written the
most impressive temperance tract of our time.
(I wonder whether Cornelia noticed that it is
a temperance tract.)</p>

<p>Thirdly, women are discovering various means<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
of avoiding the inevitable penalties which the
earlier novelists inflicted upon sorrowful blue-eyed
girls who stooped to folly: they don’t, in
fiction at least, so often have to abandon a baby
(<em>Adam Bede</em>), or to lose their job (<em>Esther Waters</em>),
or to be barred from marriage (<em>Tess of the Durbervilles</em>),
or to suffer ostracism or exile (<em>David
Copperfield</em>).</p>

<p>Fourthly, as in the use of cocktails and tobacco,
the double standard is manifestly giving ground
before a single standard, and that a masculine
standard: see any novel of the literary and artistic
“villages” of New York or Chicago—for example,
those of Mr. Floyd Dell. In Meredith
Nicholson’s <em>Broken Barriers</em>, an extraordinary disclosure
from the Indiana school, unchastity is
almost blandly presented as, for a considerable
group of young business women, something like
the accepted avenue to social advancement and
as a preliminary to a good marriage.</p>

<p>Fifthly, chastity, legal and spiritual, has for a
dozen years been under fire in this country as a
distinctive aspect of that “Puritanism” which,
as we know, must be destroyed, root and branch,
before we shall have any art, letters, or society
that are really worth mention.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>Sixthly, the idea of sex as a sacred mystery,
under protection of Church and State, has given
ground before an interesting series of competing
ideas: the idea of sex as a chapter in physiology;
the idea of sex as a social asset and a contribution
which every good mixer makes to the occasion;
and the idea of sex as a horrible nuisance.</p>

<p>Seventhly, there is appearing here and there in
current literature evidence of the growth among
us of an æsthetic philosophy which rejects the
moral valuations of life. Its doctrine is briefly
this:—You can’t be sure that any act will yield
you happiness. You can’t be sure that any act
will be virtuous. You can be sure that every act
will yield you experience. Let us go in for experience,
and value our acts according to the
quantity and intensity of the experience which
they yield.</p>

<p>Mr. Hergesheimer at present, I think, best represents
the æsthetic point of view. I am afraid
that Mr. Hergesheimer is just a little bit of a
<em>poseur</em>. He pretends to feel surprised that many
people regard his books as of immoral tendency.
I myself am not one of those who are much worried
by the moral aspects of his work. If he were
content to let the novels speak for themselves,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
few people would guess how unorthodox the author
is. As a matter of fact Mr. Hergesheimer is
a renegade Presbyterian. He is a Presbyterian
turned artist. He is proud of his apostasy and
he likes to talk about it. He has shaken off his
patrimonial “Puritanism”; he finds life more
delectable since; and he delights to find a cool
spot in a Havana hotel, and to stretch out his legs
and discourse somewhat expansively, for the
benefit of his fellow citizens north of the Gulf,
upon his “emancipation,” with frequent pointed
references to his informal dinner-jacket of Chinese
silk, the orange blossoms in his buttonhole, the
flourished Larrañaga cigar in his fingers, and the
frigid mixture of Ron Bacardi, sugar, and vivid
green lime at his elbow.</p>

<p>As an artist, he is interested in two things: first
in the luxurious, the colorful, the exotic; and
second, in the poetry of passionate idealisms,
martyr-hot. He himself exhibits a middle-aged
prudence and coolness; he possesses a certain
amount of taste of a certain kind, which preserves
him from a certain kind of now popular grossness;
he paints himself as a connoisseur of sensations:
these qualities, together with his old-fashioned
romantic attachment to “grand passions,” give<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
him a salient distinction, indeed real isolation,
among the “Jacksonian rabble” who imagine that
Mr. Hergesheimer is one of them, and who still
constitute the main body of the anti-Puritan
movement. Yet, as an artist, he finds himself
constrained to be essentially an anti-moralist.
He welcomes all experience in proportion to its
intensity and richness of color. He cannot help
admitting his “preference for girls who have the
courage of their emotions.” He cannot help confessing
his artistic pleasure in observing a crucifix
as the background of a prostitute. He cannot
deny himself the revenge upon his Presbyterian
ancestors, which consists in referring to the prostitutes
of a house in Havana as “informal girls,”
as if, forsooth, when one emerges from the ancestral
hypocrisies of Presbyterianism, “formality”
remains the only real distinction between these
girls and any other sort of girls.</p>

<p>Oh Cornelia—I begin to understand what
troubles you!</p>

<p>Mr. D. H. Lawrence seems to have set out
with the notion that sex is the greatest thing in
the world, and with the correlative notion that
we can’t very well have too much of it, or have it
on too easy terms. He is still, if I understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</span>
him, a great believer in experience for experience’s
sake, and he passes in many quarters for a
dangerous immoralist. To the conventional sense,
indeed, he may easily appear to write his novels
as if the world of conventional morals had no
existence. Even in <em>Sons and Lovers</em>, his heroes
and heroines explore their sexual good where
they find it with barbaric or <em>übermenschlich</em>
indifference to legality—or, should one say, with
the indifference to legality prevalent among a
coal-mining population? In his more recently
published <em>Women in Love</em>, his seekers of experience
and self-realization are men and women who have
exhausted the possibilities of gratification through
any ordinary intimacy of relationship. The book
has offended pudency by a few intelligible paragraphs
of plain speech where we were formerly
accustomed to silence. But its really shocking
aspect is its studious, remorseless revelation of
what a horrible, devouring mania sexual passion
may be: how involved with mortal fear; and with
cold, probing curiosity; and with murderous hatred.
One of the characteristic high spots in the story
is that in which Hermione expresses the kind
of intimacy that she desires with Birkin, and
consummates her “voluptuous ecstasy” by seizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
a beautiful ball of lapis lazuli and bringing it
crashing down upon his head. Except for a lively
incident of this sort here and there, <em>Women in
Love</em> must impress the ordinary novel-reader as
intolerably dull, dreary, difficult, and mad: and
anyone who declares that it makes sex attractive
should be punished by being required to read it
through.</p>

<p>Mr. Lawrence’s interest in it is predominantly
the interest of an exploring moralist who has
specialized in sexual relations and is coming to
conclusions which are important, if true. He is
coming to the conclusion that—for men, at any
rate—passional surrender is not the greatest
thing in the world. He is coming to the conclusion
that the romantic poets and the romantic novelists—including,
perhaps, Mr. Wells and Mr. Galsworthy—have
all been on the wrong tack in
representing as the height of human experience
that ecstasy in which one individuality is merged
and absorbed in another. This he regards as in
its essential nature an ideal of decadence. This is
an aspiration toward death and disintegration,
from which the inevitable reaction is disgust.
The virtue of a man is to preserve his own integrity
and resist the dissolution of union. “When<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
he makes the sexual consummation the supreme
consummation, even in his secret soul, he falls
into the beginnings of despair.” I quote this
sentence from Mr. Lawrence’s fantastic and
curious <em>Fantasia of the Unconscious</em>. And from
his <em>Studies in Classic American Literature</em> I
quote these words, calculated to trouble both
his enemies and his friends: “The essential function
of art is moral. Not æsthetic, nor decorative,
nor pastime and recreation, but moral. The
essential function of art is moral.” This will perhaps
trouble Mr. Hergesheimer more than it
troubles me.</p>

<p>Among the later novelists of the Middle West
one might choose either Sherwood Anderson or
Ben Hecht as a striking representative of the anti-Puritan
movement. But there is so much cloudy
symbolism in the author of <em>Many Marriages</em> that
one may more expeditiously indicate the position
of the author of <em>Gargoyles</em>—and of less widely
circulated works. Mr. Hecht, generally speaking,
appears to be the inheritor of Mr. Dreiser’s moral
outfit, during the latter’s lifetime. He interests me
more than Mr. Dreiser ever did, because his
intellectual processes are much more rapid. Mr.
Dreiser reaches his conclusion by a slow, vermiculous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
emotional approach, like the promenade
of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lumbricus terrestris</i>; Mr. Hecht darts at
his like a wasp. He is a stylist, and he feels a
kind of ecstasy in the stabbing use of words.
He is a satirist exulting in the stripping of shams.
In <em>Gargoyles</em>, he is a cynic with the point of mad
King Lear crying:—</p>

<p class="no-indent fs90">Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!<br>
Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thy own back.<br>
Thou hotly lusts to use her in that kind<br>
For which thou whip’st her.</p>

<p>He is an angry and disenchanted moralist.
But he is also—and this is the particularly
interesting aspect of his case—an angry and
disenchanted “immoralist.” The emancipated
heroes of <em>Gargoyles</em> and <em>Erik Dorn</em> hurl themselves
over precipices of experience to wallow in
abysses of spiritual inanity and despair. Yet
before they are emancipated, as Mr. Hecht sees
them, they are in an equal agony of moral chains.
Basine, in <em>Gargoyles</em>, loathes all women for his
wife’s sake. “His distaste for his wife kept him
faithful to her because his imagination baulked
at the idea of embracing another Henrietta.”
Again we are told—almost in the Dreiserian
phraseology—that “cowardice” had made him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
an excited champion of domestic felicity, marital
fidelity, and kindred ideas.</p>

<p>In his symbolical romance, Mr. Hecht represents
man as an agonized animal, self-crucified on the
cross of his moral ideals, martyrizing himself in
behalf of laws and conventions to which his
desires and appetites are in unvanquishable opposition.
Hitherto, his satire of conventional sexual
morality has not revealed to me any constructive
element: its caustic and sulphurous bolts leap
from an anarchical darkness of all-embracing
disillusion and fathomless disgust.</p>

<p>The note of sexual disgust is, to the student of
contemporary morals, a point of high interest
in the recent realistic fiction. This note of disgust
is clamorous in <em>Blackguard</em>, by Mr. Hecht’s
spiritual satellite, Mr. Maxwell Bodenheim. It is
a steady undertone through the novels and short
stories of Sherwood Anderson; in <em>The Narrow
House</em> and <em>Narcissus</em> of Evelyn Scott; and in
the <em>Rahab</em> of Waldo Franck. It is a cry of diabolic
torture in James Joyce’s <em>Portrait of the Artist as
Young Man</em>; and in <em>Ulysses</em> it is a rolling ordurous
pandemonium.</p>

<p>In reading the novels of Ben Hecht, Maxwell
Bodenheim, Sherwood Anderson, Evelyn Scott,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
Waldo Franck, and James Joyce, one’s first impression
is frequently of wonder as to what
motive can prompt an author to perpetuate a
record of experience so humiliatingly painful, and
a vision of souls so atrociously ugly. Is the
motive revenge upon life for having taken them
in? Is the motive to cleanse the stuffed bosom
of the perilous stuff that preys upon the reason?
The mad King Lear perhaps felt relieved when
he had completed his psychoanalysis of the
“simp’ring dame”; but when he had reached
his conclusion in “burning, scalding, stench, consumption,”
he cried perforce: “Give me an ounce
of civet, good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination!”
In the Emetic School of fiction appears the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad nauseam</i> of the idea of sex as a social
asset. No lust-bitten monk wrestling with hallucinations
in a mediaæval cloister could have
made the entire subject more bewilderingly
detestable than this group of anti-Puritan and
anti-Catholic emancipators, who apparently set
out with a desire to make it pleasant.</p>

WE DISCUSS MARRIAGE AND THE HOPE
OF THE YOUNGER GENERATION</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">At this point, as it seemed to me, I had accumulated
sufficient material to enable me to resume
my conversation with Cornelia, without being
immediately extinguished by the immense superiority
of her intuitions regarding what is right.
Meditating on the evolution of the idea of chastity
from Goldsmith and Scott to James Joyce and
Ben Hecht, I went to see her again.</p>

<p>It was a pleasant midsummer morning, enlivened
by a cool breeze from the lake. I came up
through the wood path into the garden, and found
her sitting in the pergola, cool and fresh as the
breeze. Her hands lay still in her lap, clasped
upon an open book. Unaware of my presence,
her gaze seemed to have gone dreamingly down
the green slope, to rest in a kind of hovering
question above the bright young animation of
the tennis court. As I appeared, she looked up
quickly and said instantly:—</p>

<p>“Sit here, and let me read you these lovely
verses of Walter de la Mare’s.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span></p>

<p>“Do,” I replied; and she read with—oh, just a
suspicion of a tremor in her clear smooth voice,
these lines:—</p>

<p>She closed the book, and we were silent for
a moment, in which I felt within myself curious
little surges of sympathy breaking over rocks
of difference. And then she said: “Well?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span></p>

<p>“Cornelia,” I answered, “you were right. The
idea of chastity has been challenged, is being
challenged, on all sides, in many ways, for many
reasons.”</p>

<p>I made a discreet summary of my discoveries,
and concluded: “Current fiction reflects a
condition bordering on anarchy.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t one know that without making an
investigation, without ploughing through these
dreadful books?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” I responded; “but, Cornelia, I
think you are wrong in an important respect. I
think there has been a real change in standards,
and that even very nice people no longer think
just as they used to think. At least, they no
longer say what they used to say, and they are
immeasurably more tolerant of what other people
think.”</p>

<p>“Do you imagine,” she persisted, “that this
new tolerance indicates general moral progress?
I think it indicates general moral laxity. Come,
let us be definite. At what points precisely do
you fancy there is any advantage to be gained
by taking sexual relations away from the protection
of Church and State and committing
them to the whims of individuals?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span></p>

<p>“My dear Cornelia,” I protested, “the prevailing
theory is not that Church and State have
‘protected’ sexual relations. The popular theory
is that Church and State have ignored them—or,
at least, in attempting to regulate them, have
ignored so many exceptional cases that the regulations
are invalid. For all these cases, the novel
has been a kind of court of last resort. On the
whole, I believe that it has greatly enriched the
ideal of virtue by giving a hearing to the innumerable
cases in which legality is the mask of nearly
intolerable conditions.”</p>

<p>“Intolerable conditions,” interrupted Cornelia,
“are usually the result of imprudent marriages,
marriages for advantage, marriages without love.
Those who make such marriages should expect
to pay the price. It is sentimentality to discard
a good rule to save a few exceptional individuals.
Incompatibility of temper is no harder to bear
than smallpox or anything else that marriage
may let one in for.”</p>

<p>“I am explaining how we differ,” I resumed.
“I find myself in pretty full sympathy with the
current tendency to revolt against the doctrine
of the irretrievable as applied by Goldsmith and
certain of the Victorians. The earlier Georgian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
principle that virtue, in this connection, means to
maintain permanent relations with one who is
thoroughly agreeable to you begins to sound to
my ears like orthodoxy, as does also the companion
principle, that to maintain permanent relations
with one who is thoroughly disagreeable to you
is vice. And though I am not ready to subscribe
to all the possible corollaries of these two positions,
I seem to see, gradually emerging from them, a
new and better idea of chastity—of clean relationships—which
will make “nice” people not
less but more fastidious in their intimacies, not
less but more austere in yielding the citadel of
body and spirit.”</p>

<p>“Nothing will emerge from these principles,”
said Cornelia decisively, “without a rule—without
a rule which Church and State can enforce
upon people who are not nice. You have admitted
that the Wells-Galsworthy test of successful
marriage tends to be ‘unworkable.’ You admit
that the word ‘permanent’ tends to drop out of
the principle, and that then you have, instead
of a substitute for law, a permission for anarchy.
You even admit that the novelists already reflect
a condition approaching anarchy. Don’t you
think, after all, it is about time to call a halt?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span></p>

<p>“No,” I insisted stubbornly; “the movement
of indefinite anarchical expansion halts itself.
And I stand by the novelists, even by the Emetic
School, as showing where the movement halts:
in blind alleys, against iron necessities, in miasmic
swamps, in ennui, in despair, in disgust unfathomable.
You cannot guess, Cornelia; without years
of such reading as I am happily certain you will
never undertake, you cannot understand what
comfort and reassurance I find in the fathomless
disgust exhibited in our most advanced novelists—disgust
for the life that is dedicated to sex.
The disgust of the novelists upholds the splendor
of the Church and the majesty of the Law.
Upborne by the disgust of the novelists, like a
ship by the briny behemoth-haunted deep,
marriage may yet spread again her proud full
sail for fresh voyages. These novelists reveal
obscene things in their deep-sea caves, but they
administer whatever antidote is required to the
obscenity of their speech. They drive home their
moral with an appalling effectiveness beyond the
rivalry of critical comment. They deliver the
shattering challenge to unchastity. They have
shown the emancipated moderns capable of dodging
all but one of the consequences which their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
elders appointed for unchastity; but they have
not shown the moderns capable of dodging the
stench of a disintegrated personality, which fumes
in their books like a last irreducible hell. To
safeguard the innocency of your son and daughter,
I incline to believe that one whiff from these
caverns might be as potent as Heine’s prayer.
Consciously or not, these novelists are preparing
a counter-revolution.”</p>

<p>“What direction, pray, will that take?” inquired
Cornelia, to whom God has beautifully
denied ability to follow such an argument.</p>

<p>“I shall not prophesy in detail,” I said, looking
down the slope towards the tennis court. “Is
your contribution to the Younger Generation
in that match?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied, “and isn’t it delightful to
see how keen they are about it?”</p>

<p>“It is. It indicates to me one of the directions
of the counter-revolution. Historians in the future,
surveying the monuments of our children’s time,
are going to refer to this as the beginning of the
great age of stadium-building in America. They
will see in this movement a religious significance,
not yet visible to us; and they will expatiate in
glowing terms on the period when, with extravagant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>
and sacrificial adoration of an ideal, our
youth exalted the cleanness and hardness of
athletic games, and religiously subjected themselves
to the rules and rigor of the game—to that
arbitrary, elaborate, inflexible, yet self-imposed
system of ethics which alone makes any good
game possible. I am hoping that our children’s
generation will contain more real sportsmen than
ours did—fewer quitters, fewer squealers, fewer
players crying out to have the rules changed after
the game is on; and no one so silly as to suppose
there can be a game without rules.”</p>

<p>“That hope is rather remote, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Rather. I have another, more immediate.
I hope that in the early stages of the counter-revolution
our sophisticated sons and daughters
will scrutinize ‘the idea of sex,’ coolly extract
from it the part that belongs to physiology and
pathology; and then disuse the word as synonym
for every other element in the complex human
relationship which sometimes makes human beings
paradisiacally happy in their blossoming season
and content enough with each other even into
wintry old age. I have some hope that the Emetic
School may help our children to understand
that sex and sexual self-realization are not, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
the long view, the main substance of what youth
hungers for.”</p>

<p>“Go on!” cried Cornelia, encouragingly.</p>

<p>“I hope that they will make real progress in
psychoanalysis. I hope that, when they feel the
ache of the soul’s ultimate solitude and are restless
and full of vague desires they may be capable
of lucid introspection; that they may be frank and
plain with themselves, and call things by their
right names, and say to themselves something like
this: ‘I am filled with tedium and passionate craving.
I shall be hard to satisfy, for I am thirsty for
a deep draught of human felicity. What I crave
is not described or named in the physiologies.
I crave beauty, sympathy, sweetness, incentive,
perfume, difference, vivacity, wit, cleanness,
grace, devotion, caprice, pride, kindness, blitheness,
fortitude. I will not look for these things where
I know they cannot be found, nor under conditions
in which I know they cannot be maintained. But
if I find them, and where they thrive, I shall
wish to express my joy by some great act of faith
and the hazard of all I hope to be. And I shall
not like the town clerk to be the sole recorder of
my discovery and my faith. I shall wish witnesses,
high witnesses, whatever is august and splendid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
in the order of the world, to enwheel me round
and bid me welcome to that order.’ That is the sort
of self-realization to which I hope our sons and
daughters are coming.”</p>

<p>Cornelia smiled with a kind of malicious sweetness
that she has. She was satisfied. She rather
yearned, I perceived well enough, to remark that
now at last I was taking the “stand” that she
had taken from the first. But Cornelia is one of
the few women now living who do not say everything
that they yearn to say. She merely released
one arrowy smile. Then she rose, as I had done
already,—standing, she reminds one of Artemis,—and
extending her hand, detained mine with
another deep question. She asked me whether I
knew any “living reason” to believe that my
emancipated young people would return to that
ideal.</p>

<p>The opportunity was irresistible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “I have known you, Cornelia.”</p>

CORNELIA’S CHILDREN REACT TO
A SUITABLE MATCH</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">There was a wedding at noon in the village
church, a couple of miles from our summer community
by the lake, and as most of our colony
were somewhat interested in the girl, we turned
out in force. It was an outwardly festive and—to
my sense—agreeably solemn little affair. There
was a bank of lady’s-slippers and maidenhair ferns
before the altar, and the air was heavy with the
sweetly mortal scent of lilies. The clergyman in
white vestments had a full consciousness of the
finality of his function. He joined in permanent
wedlock a white, smiling, tearful bride of twenty
to a well-dressed groom of thirty-five, who looked
very experienced, very serious, and slightly bald.
Cornelia, who is a connoisseur, whispered to me
that it was in every respect a “most suitable
match.” I made a mental note to ask her at the
next opportunity what the essentials of a suitable
match were. I happened, however, to ride away
from the ceremony in the rear seat of her car,
sandwiched between her two children, Dorothy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</span>
and Oliver Junior; and their comment was less
flattering.</p>

<p>“Bah!” exclaimed Oliver. “Let’s go and have
a swim. It made me sick.”</p>

<p>“Me too,” said Dorothy. “It made me cold all
over to hear her promising to forsake all others
and keep herself only for that wizened—stick.
Why should she forsake all others, just because
she is married? It sounds as if she were going as
missionary to the Indians.”</p>

<p>“Or as trained nurse to an isolation hospital,”
Oliver suggested.</p>

<p>“When I am married,” said Dorothy, “I shall
not forsake all others—at least, unless I get a
better one than that.”</p>

<p>“You are severe critics,” I murmured, secretly
delighted to observe that the children were using
the dialect of their feelings, rather than that polite
language which well-bred youth, like Japanese
ladies, employ in presence of their elders. “At
what age do you expect to be married, Dorothy?”</p>

<p>“I shall never marry!” she replied with a deep
blush. She is of course at exactly the correct age
for saying that. But if you haven’t seen her, you
can have no adequate notion how dire and how
delicious that threat is on her lips. She inherits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>
“eligibility” from both her parents. Her mother
has a clear, expressive, sunlit loveliness; but
Dorothy’s beauty has in it an element of subtlety—from
her father—and a suggestion of sorcery
and peril. She has her mother’s complexion but
her father’s eyes. It is the unexpected combination
and contrast that fascinates one: the filleted
blond hair and the fluent roses of the fair skin,
with the brown eyes, dark yet full of lambent
lights—eyes of which the centres seem gleaming
paths, leading into shadows where a man might
easily wander and be lost.</p>

<p>“And why won’t you marry?” I pursued; for
as we were driving at a good speed over a rough
road, I was sure the watchful maternal ears could
not overhear us. And so was Dorothy.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t like the choice,” she said, “that
marriage presents—nowadays.”</p>

<p>“A choice!” I repeated with irreverent levity.
“You haven’t come to that yet, I trust. But
what do you think the choice is going to be?”</p>

<p>“You may laugh,” said Dorothy, “but we all
know well enough. We don’t have to wait till we
have made it, to know what the choice is. It is
either a ‘good American husband,’ ten or twenty
years older than you, who has a fine position and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
a character and nice middle-aged friends, and can
give you a home and a social circle and clothes and
things—but hasn’t anything to say to you. He
simply hasn’t anything to say to you.”</p>

<p>“Why do you keep hollering, ‘He hasn’t anything
to say to you’?” mocked her brother. “Who
hasn’t anything to say? Who? Who? Who?”</p>

<p>“Shut up!” said Dorothy, with more sweetness
than the words can carry. “You heard. I said,
‘The good American husband has nothing to say
to you.’”</p>

<p>“That is rather a defect,” I assented wickedly,
“if you’ve got to be alone with him for the rest of
your life. Yes, it’s a rather serious defect in a man
with whom, forsaking all others, a girl of twenty
expects to spend the next fifty years. But Dorothy,
if you don’t take a good American husband, what
is the alternative?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a boy of your own age, of course,” she
answered promptly. “A boy that you like—like
in all ways, I mean: like his voice, like his eyes, like
the temperature of his hands—not like fins. He
talks with you about the things that interest you—they
are just the same as the things that interest
him; and you like to do things with him; and if
there is anything perfectly splendid, you wish he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</span>
were there; and whenever you see him coming,
your heart begins to dance.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “that seems an attractive
sketch. Why not choose a boy like that?”</p>

<p>“Because,” she explained, “it seems as if nowadays
none of the boys that one really likes is ever
going to amount to much. At any rate, you must
wait till your doddering old age before you can
hope to be married—and what’s the use then?
He won’t be interesting to me, and I won’t be nice
for him—then. But we’ll just sit around in
padded chairs, with ear-trumpets in our ears, and
yell, ‘Whadye say?’ at each other; and wish it
were bedtime.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite understand the reason for this
postponement.”</p>

<p>“If,” she said, “they are boys of your own age,
and enjoy the books and music that you do, and
are nice to dance with, why, then they think they
are going to be poets or composers, and so they
don’t work, and they flunk out of school—and
your mother asks you why you persist in playing
around with ‘that worthless fellow’—doesn’t
she, Oliver?”</p>

<p>“Yep!” said her brother, and grinned.</p>

<p>Dorothy, leaning across my knees, first pinched,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
then patted him, and said: “Poor old Ollie! He’s
nicer than almost any boy I know, and yet Dad
says he’s a ‘worthless fellow,’ too.”</p>

<p>When I suggested that the only hope was to take
one of these nice worthless fellows and put some
“starch” into him, the rear seat burst into a peal
of conspirant laughter. Possibly that hope had
been tried. Cornelia whirled around upon us, and
demanded:—</p>

<p>“What are you children talking about?”</p>

<p>I answered sedately that we were discussing
education for life, and that there were certain
points on which I should like her opinion. But we
were now at the clump of Rural Free Delivery
boxes, where the path comes down from my cottage.
Intimating that I might “drop around” toward the
end of the afternoon, I got out, and having handed
up Cornelia’s mail, walked home with my own. It
proved rather piquantly amusing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II-2">II<br>
“LET’S WALK”</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">There was a light rain at lunch-time, but it blew
over, leaving the out-of-doors extraordinarily inviting.
After I had written for two or three hours,
I found myself walking—and chuckling—up
the path through the birches to Cornelia’s place.
Under the hemlocks near the house, I passed
Dorothy, in white tennis-attire with a sketchy
sweater the color of California poppies, curled up
in a hammock with a book. A young girl alone
fills me with awe, like a cardinal building a nest;
and I always try to slip past without disturbance—I
feel that her mind must be occupied with
something beautiful.</p>

<p>“What are you reading?” I called by way of
greeting.</p>

<p>“I’m not reading,” she replied, “I’m waiting
for the young man that mother likes to have me
play tennis with.”</p>

<p>With an additional chuckle, I proceeded to the
front of the house. My original merriment had
been occasioned by two letters, in the morning
mail, from correspondents at large who desired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
me to inform them whether Cornelia was “real.” I
was also wondering how much of these letters I
could discreetly disclose to her.</p>

<p>She met me on the threshold of the wide verandah,
standing for an instant tiptoe in a practicable
yet perfect sylvan costume, and framed between
two tall Chinese vases of wild tiger-lilies, which
made a little pattern with the glints in her hair
and the knot of soft flame at her breast.</p>

<p>“Let’s walk!” she said.</p>

<p>“Let’s,” I replied; and we struck briskly into
the abandoned road which runs, carpeted with
bindweed and bittersweet, for miles and miles
skirting the forest, with only a thin curtain of
young silver poplars and birches between it and
the lake. Cornelia is a light, crisp-footed walker,—at
her gayest walking, and good for long distances,—my
only complaint being that she has forgotten
how to loiter. She seems rather bent upon reaching
the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terminus ad quem</i> than careful to let me fall a
step to the rear, where I may consider with more
detachment how, like a dryad, she expresses and
completes the woodland vista.</p>

<p>“I had a letter this morning,” I began, “from an
unknown lady. It would amuse you.”</p>

<p>“Would it indeed?” said Cornelia, moving<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span>
swiftly forward and at the same time calling my
attention to the twittering brown flutter of a tree
full of cedar-wings.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I insisted, “I’m sure it’s as interesting
as bird study. This lady doubts your existence.
Listen to this.” I pulled forth a delicately tinted
letter with a faint scent which died among the
pungent fresh odors of the rain-washed air. “‘Tell
me,’ she writes, ‘whether Cornelia is real. If she
is, I hope you are not in love with her. She is the
feminine of Sir Austin Feverel. She has no heart.
She is just unfaltering correctness. As a girl, I
fancy, she folded her still hands in her lap and
calmly waited till her family had consulted the
bankers and the genealogists before she decided to
care for the man she married. As a woman, she
wishes to inspect and authorize every passion
before she allows it to peep. I pity her children.
She has never done a thing in her life merely
because for one rapturous hour it seemed the
most desirable thing in the wide world to do. I
should hate her.’”</p>

<p>Cornelia brushed me sidelong with the sweep of
her gray eyes, of which the effect, when one catches
it so, is like that of the cool rays of a May sun
bent to a focus under a burning-glass. But she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
only said, “What queer correspondents you have!
And what a charming impression of me you have
given them! Am I as hateful as that?”</p>

<p>It isn’t difficult to say complimentary things to
Cornelia. The difficulty is not to say them. But I
make it a practice not to answer rhetorical questions.
They divert one from one’s point. “Please
remember,” I said, carving my accents on the
air with my crabtree stick and looking straight
ahead, “please remember that this is not my portrait
of you, but only the comment of one woman
upon the image of another woman reflected in
the eyes of a man who has worn spectacles for
many years. But I have another letter—from a
novelist; he has a quite different theory of you.”</p>

<p>“Is it nice?” asked Cornelia, with a demipirouette
and the instinctive capricious smile of a
very pretty woman about to step before a mirror.
“You should tell me something very nice to offset
the spitefulness of that horrid person. But what a
silly question! Your letter is from a novelist; so
of course it isn’t nice. Is it?”</p>

<p>“No,” I replied, “I’m afraid it isn’t nice—in
your sense of the word; but it is interesting—in
my sense of the word. I call a thing interesting,
you see, when it seems to be earnestly pointing in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span>
the direction where truth, like a rabbit, has just
disappeared in the bushes. Now, this novelist belongs
to the large and productive group of hunters
who are leaving the highroad to pursue truth into
the underbrush. His theory of you is not a personal
reflection upon you; it is only part of his
general theory of society and human nature.”</p>

<p>“Bah! bah! bah!” Cornelia exclaimed. “I’m
sick of human nature—their theories of it, I
mean. I love people, but I hate what our current
writers say about them. Life is so much more
decent, when one knows how to live and whom to
live with, than any of our novelists will admit. I
have the same feeling in the theatre. I go to a play
and see nothing in it that can compare with the
quality of real experience—if one has any taste
and discrimination. But tell me, now, what does
this dreadful creature say about me?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll take the risk,” I said, “since you have
the courage or the curiosity to insist on it.” I
pulled out the second letter. “What he says is
this: ‘I am afraid your Cornelia is not real. For
me, at any rate, she doesn’t exist. She isn’t
elemental. She isn’t spontaneous. She strikes me
as a theoretical construction to please a Victorian
grandmother. Or perhaps I had better call her an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
old bachelor’s pipe dream of a lady. One can’t
write modern fiction from that point of view. It’s
insubstantial. We realists have been demonstrating
now for years that Judith O’Grady and the
Colonel’s lady are very much alike beneath the
skin. We have destroyed the legend of the lady,
and we have destroyed the legend of the gentleman.
We have put them out of their misery: they
don’t exist any more. We’re just men and women
together. If you don’t know Cornelia as a wife,
you don’t know her—you don’t know her as a
realist. Women are not like her—not inside. Go
beneath the surface, and you’ll find the Judith
O’Grady in Cornelia.’”</p>

<p>“What nonsense!” cried Cornelia. “What perfect
nonsense! Give it to me.” And almost
snatching the letter from my hand, she tore it into
fine shreds, and tossed it showering into a wild
currant bush.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III">III<br>
PREREQUISITES OF A DECENT MARRIAGE</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">“Don’t you see,” she continued, as we came
over the brow of a little hill, “why I can’t have
Dorothy reading these current novels? I don’t
wish her to be what this creature calls ‘elemental’
and ‘spontaneous.’ I wish her to be civilized
and rational—and not a well-dressed little savage,
ready to act at once on whatever passion or fancy
or circumstances put into her head. I wish her to
associate with people who are rational and civilized,
and, when she marries, I wish her to marry a
man who is civilized and rational. Do you know,
that in the course of the last year I have met just
one man in fiction who seems to have retained elements
of the ideas of a gentleman,—or rather,
one man and his father,—I mean the hero of
Struthers Burt’s <em>The Interpreter’s House</em>. As for
Mr. Burt’s women, they are almost as uncivilized
as anybody’s.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t there a season of life,” I suggested,
“in which almost everyone has some uncivilized
promptings?”</p>

<p>“Is there a season in life,” countered Cornelia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
“when a properly trained person cannot present
at least the appearance of discretion?”</p>

<p>“My dear Cornelia,” I said, “do you ever glance
through those columns in our great national fireside
magazines, in which wise old editors converse
with their contributors and advise young girls how
to catch a man?”</p>

<p>Cornelia smiled, and then abruptly became very
firm and grave. “That is it,” she said. “That is
exactly it—‘how to catch a man’! And the
dreadful thing is that the tone of our entire popular
discussion and our popular literature is just about
at that level—as if the mere possession of anything
in the shape of a man were so unquestionably
desirable that no scruple must be raised regarding
his family and social position, his religion and
principles of personal conduct, his property and
prospects and professional standing. We are becoming
absurd in our carelessness about such
matters.”</p>

<p>“But that,” I protested, “is just what makes the
beauty of life in America.”</p>

<p>“That,” said Cornelia, “is what makes American
life so ugly—no respect for any of the things
that make people respectable, no sense for the substantial
basis of social distinctions, no regard for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
the hedges and barriers behind which one tries to
cultivate the flowers of a finer garden.”</p>

<p>“That,” I said, “is the really decisive evidence
of our freedom from snobbishness.”</p>

<p>“It is the decisive evidence,” said Cornelia, “of
our deficiency in taste.”</p>

<p>“You lack patience,” I persisted. “It is the new
social wisdom of democracy.”</p>

<p>“It is the new social idiocy of democracy,” she
replied; “and let me assure you there is none of it
in my house. If I lack patience, I possess some
experience. I was taught by my mother to be kind
and considerate to servants—my old nurse loved
me like a daughter. And I was taught at home
and in church to be charitable to poor people and
ignorant people and people without advantages
and without manners. But I was also brought up
to believe that a nice girl had better be dead than
form a sentimental relationship with one who was
not in her class—not a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think that is—a rather silly and
outworn prejudice?” I ventured.</p>

<p>“I certainly do not,” she replied. “I think the
salvation of a girl is her pride—legitimate pride
in her family, her position, her connections. I
have conscientiously striven to train my daughter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</span>
to feel that, so far as her personal fortunes are concerned,
common people—that is, vulgar ordinary
people—simply are not in the world. Call it
snobbishness, if you like; I am proud of it.”</p>

<p>“But Cornelia,” I said, “can’t you concede
that in the relation we are discussing, there is something
more elemental and imperative than can
be governed by such considerations as you put
foremost?”</p>

<p>“Yes—to the sense of animals and savages.
Yes—to the sense of vulgar and ignorant people.
To the sense of what my mother used to call
gentlefolk—emphatically, No. To them, there
can be nothing more elemental and imperative
than just those considerations which distinguish
them from the ignorant and the vulgar.”</p>

<p>“You yourself have half apologized for the old
word, ‘gentlefolk,’” I nagged. “Please tell me
what gentlefolk were, or rather, what a gentleman
is. Must he belong to the Church and be a member
of the militia? For how many generations must he
be able to trace his family? How much money
must he have in the bank? How much of the
Decalogue and how many rules for perfect behavior
may he break in a day, without losing
caste? Are you quite clear about all this?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</span></p>

<p>“You have a very irritating way,” said Cornelia,
“of trying to make the most sensible and obvious
positions absurd to maintain. But you know I am
right. You know that there is nothing absurd in
being conscious of the claims of the Church and the
State and the established system of morals and
manners. You know there is nothing absurd in
being conscious of the significance of money in
enabling one to take and maintain a position of
dignity and influence. A man has no dignity nor
influence until he enters relations with the instituted
and continuing forms of society. And though
silly little girls may think they could spend a happy
lifetime ‘traipsing’ after a gipsy minstrel, a
wife knows better. Every married woman knows
that a husband without dignity or influence is a
perpetual humiliation.”</p>

<p>“Very possibly,” I said; “but you were going to
define a gentleman.”</p>

<p>“Why, a gentleman,” said Cornelia, “is a man
so well bred and so intelligent that he knows what
I have just been saying, without being told; consequently
he doesn’t ask a nice girl to marry him
if he is aware that he can offer her nothing but perpetual
humiliation. A gentleman is a man whose
character has been formed by the standards of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</span>
civilized and rational people. To him these considerations
are so elementary and so familiar that
he acts upon them spontaneously.”</p>

<p>“Then you would admit,” I suggested, a little
petulantly, “that what a man is, <em>after</em> he is a vestryman,
an officer in the militia, and a property-holder,
may have a certain remote bearing on—on
the felicity of a marriage, if you think that of
any importance?”</p>

<p>“Of course I think that of importance,” responded
Cornelia. “Don’t be foolish. I am discussing
the conditions in which felicity begins to be
possible. You recall what Henry James says so
beautifully: ‘The object of money is to enable one
to forget it.’ In the whole course of my life, I believe
I was never before hectored into saying so
flatly what the prerequisites of a decent marriage
are. But you and your novelist friends—you
realists, as you call yourselves—have filled the
world with the glorification of merely instinctive
and utterly irrational ‘matings,’ or with childish
sentimentality about them; so that now, when I
talk with Dorothy about suitable and unsuitable
marriages, I find myself obliged to reconstruct for
her the very rudiments of common-sense.”</p>

<p>I do not consider Cornelia subtle, but sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>
she says the same things that she would say if she
were subtle. However, if I was being instructed
over the head of her daughter, I did not propose
to acknowledge it. “My dear Cornelia,” I remonstrated,
“do you forget that I am not Dorothy?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “but I often think you are just
as sentimental.”</p>

CORNELIA APPRECIATES HER HUSBAND</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The old road dips here into a hollow, where an
extensive thicket of wild roses encroaches upon it
and diminishes it to a narrow and thorny footpath.
We picked our way through it single-file and in
silence. Cornelia, emerging some steps ahead,
turned and waited, waist-high behind the briars,
smiling—with a rose in her hand and its hue in
her face. Suddenly she seemed a long way off—twenty
years off. The breeze had brought youth
into her eyes if not into her mind. She was very
lovely, and I wished the wind might have loosened
a wisp—why couldn’t it?—of her sunlit hair;
but that was too much for the wind. Her own
arrangements had been complete.</p>

<p>She fixed the rose in my coat.</p>

<p>“Cornelia,” I said, as we footed it again together
over the vivid green gloss of dewberry leaves,
“You remind me of an old sweetheart of the
seventeenth century—who also married a diplomat.
I mean Dorothy Osborne. When Temple was
courting her, she wrote to him, oh quite delicious
letters—one in particular, in which she says she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
has been crying over the story of Baucis and
Philemon. ‘Methinks,’ she says, ‘they were the
perfectest characters of a contented marriage,
where piety and love were all their wealth, and in
their poverty feasted the gods when rich men shut
them out.’ But in that identical letter she warns
her lover that ‘<em>this is the world</em>; would you and I
were out on’t!’ And in the next letter she derides
the foolish young people who marry for love, and
pointedly reminds poor Temple that all the world
must be informed ‘what fortune you have, and
upon what terms I marry you—that both may not
be made to appear ten times worse than they are.’”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes; I remember,” Cornelia said, with—I
thought—a faint note of reverie. “Love and
wit met in that encounter, and both came away
much improved. I must give that book to my
Dorothy. She was a sensible girl—Dorothy
Osborne was a very sensible girl. It is a book that
will help a young girl to understand that she
needn’t be an idiot.”</p>

<p>“At heart,” I said, “even the sweetest of
women are as hard as nails, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Someone has to be,” said Cornelia.</p>

<p>“You mean,” I interpreted, “if the young
lovers aren’t to make fools of themselves.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “or old ones, either.”</p>

<p>“H’m,” I resumed; “what I was getting at was
this: when I was a young fellow, with even less experience
than I have now, I used rather to revel in
reading tragedies and tales of dismally bitter and
disillusioned men. All young fellows do. I suppose
it intensifies the sense of their own existence.
In the presence of dark and disastrous things—sin,
crime, murder for love, and so on—they persuade
themselves that they are drawing close to
the ‘throbbing heart of reality.’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Cornelia, “you used to like tragedy.”</p>

<p>“But now,” I said, “I am following an entirely
different clue. I have a theory that the only
matter that is really worth investigating is happiness.
And so I haunt the trails of people who
are reputed to be happy, or who act as if they
were happy; and I pester them for their secrets.”</p>

<p>“An odious habit,” she said. “Besides, you
won’t learn anything.”</p>

<p>“Cornelia,” I continued,—not solemnly, you
understand, but with my lightest touch,—“are
you as entirely happy as we all think you are?”</p>

<p>“You don’t imagine that I should tell you if I
were not, do you?” she said—this also with the
light touch. “Of course I am!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span></p>

<p>“Then I suppose that if I asked you to outline
the personal characteristics of, let us say, the sort
of man one’s daughter should choose in order to
have a high prospect of a happy marriage—why,
then you would just hand me back a quick sketch
of His Excellency, your husband, wouldn’t you?”</p>

<p>“Of course I should,” she replied without hesitation.
“I am proud of Oliver. He has made a
place for himself in public life. Men like him—he
has hosts of men friends; and his relatives are
all suitable people. He has been able to provide
amply and even lavishly for the comfort of his
family, and has given us the advantage of years of
foreign travel and residence. He cares a good deal
for appearances; but so do I. He likes to live expensively;
but he knows how to live. And he is
never, like so many men with careers, too busy to
live or to let other people live unless they can be
swept into the stream of the monster’s ambition.
He is never too busy to enjoy what he is doing.”</p>

<p>“Astonishing virtue, in the circumstances!”
groaned my envy.</p>

<p>“And then he is generous to us all—and
reasonably tolerant, and really kind-hearted and
sympathetic with people that he likes; and he and
the children positively adore one another. I like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
that in him. His temper has its stormy seasons,
but for the most part it is gay; and even when he is
very angry, he is rather entertaining. He has so
much humor that he seldom bores himself, and so
much intelligence that he seldom bores anyone
else. Everything in the world and at home seems to
interest him vividly. He thinks of something new
to do or to say every morning of his life. Whatever
man or woman he meets, seems to be the one
person in the world that he was hoping to meet at
that moment; but I think he actually doesn’t care
very much for women, except in their purely
decorative aspects. Sometimes he is a little exacting,
but he is generally appreciative; and he has
very, very nice ways of remembering birthdays
and anniversaries. And then, in tight places he always
does the right thing; in a crisis, one can rely
on him.”</p>

<p>“Cornelia,” I said, clipping a row of flame-weed
with my stick, as we quickened our pace, “I have
just passed through a terrible minute. You know
that Oliver is the only man in the world that I
envy. I have been checking off each trait of his
against my own, and the only trait that I have in
common with this happiness-producing paragon is
that my temper, too, has ‘stormy seasons.’”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span></p>

<p>“That’s too bad,” Cornelia said maliciously,
“for I don’t consider Oliver’s temper his best
trait.”</p>

<p>“No, nor do I; you omitted the finest virtue of
the perfect American husband. What I admire
most of all in Oliver is his sending you into the
country for the summer—and his sublime confidence
that he will get you back again in the fall.”</p>

<p>“The quiet is nice here, isn’t it?” she said;
“but hadn’t we better turn about? The sun is
slipping into that indigo cloud-bank.”</p>

WE DISCUSS THE INNER LIFE</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">We plunged over the ridge by a steep path to the
lake, in order to make the short return by the
shore. The wind was now blowing hard and the
waves running high. I began to feel like taking it
easy, but Cornelia is indefatigable. She drew up
her shoulders, threw back her head, drew a deep
breath, and went cutting into the wind like a
gallant yacht.</p>

<p>“Oh let’s slow down a bit,” I called. “I’ve only
just begun to understand something. Something
very important about happiness. It flashed into
my mind—literally flashed—as you struck that
Samothracian pace northward.”</p>

<p>“If it’s as important as that—” she said, relenting
a little in her stride. “But don’t you like
to walk fast? Nothing makes me so happy.”</p>

<p>“I have a theory,” I said. “One can’t walk
fast when one has a theory. It’s a theory for
which you are partly, perhaps mainly, responsible.”</p>

<p>“Then it isn’t horrid, is it?”</p>

<p>“Oh no! It is very nice indeed. But even now,
while we delay, it has grown into three theories. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>
the first place, there are no perfect husbands, and
there is probably only one perfect wife. In the
second place, happiness is in neither wives nor
husbands, but only in the relation between. In the
third place, people who are unhappy in marriage
are so, usually, because they don’t know how to
give themselves to each other. In the fourth
place,—it’s four now,—that unhappy ignorance
is chiefly due to erroneous conceptions of the self.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you mean by the self?” she said.
“My metaphysical brains are weak.”</p>

<p>“Well, the traditional, romantic, and generally
popular conception is, that the self is a very deep
and precious mystery of ‘the buried life,’ an
elusive being hidden away inside,—always inside,—in
a secret garden of the personality, where
it murmurs to itself the most delightful and ineffable
secrets, which can be communicated to any
other self only in a mystical physical fusion of
selves—or confusion of selves.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Cornelia, “I understand that. It is
something like the religious or sacramental theory
of marriage, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Something like some people’s notion of it,” I
replied. “But please follow this argument. Under
the illusion that the self is such a being, and only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
so to be come at, romantic lovers fret themselves
to a fever, and decadent heroes and heroines tear
each other to bits, and ignorant contemporary
husbands and wives separate with bitter recriminations,
each charging that the mysteriously
rewarding self sought in the other was not to be
found.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, the reason it was not found is that it was
not there. There is no such secret garden; there is
no such mysterious self to reward the mystics of
the romantic quest.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “I think, up to a certain point,
our brutal modern naturalists have followed truth
much more faithfully than the poets. And I believe
that in educating our young people we had better
follow them to the same point. My novelist friend
is right in holding to his theory that Judith
O’Grady and the Colonel’s lady are much the same
beneath the skin.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” cried Cornelia. “If you say that again,
I shall hate you.”</p>

<p>“And I shall ask to be forgiven,” I said, “and
you will forgive me so graciously that I shall sin
again. But I’m very serious about this. Judith<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
and the lady are very much the same—beneath
the skin.”</p>

<p>“I hate you!” Cornelia cried. “I could stick you
full of pins.”</p>

<p>“Beneath the skin,” I continued, “Judith and
the lady consist of closely similar metabolic apparatus
and so forth, and a certain amount of vacant
space—and nothing else. And since the apparatus
is the same, there is every reason to believe that it
functions in essentially the same way in performing
the duties assigned to it by biological destiny.”</p>

<p>“You are disgusting,” said Cornelia.</p>

<p>“If I dwelt too long on the point, I should be,”
I agreed. “Viscera and vacancy: that is what
Judith and the lady have beneath the skin. And
that is why I think the naturalistic novelists are
foolish if they dwell too long there.”</p>

<p>“Is this your nice theory?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “it isn’t; but it is a sort of basis
for my theory. First, we establish the fact that the
interesting and precious and desirable self isn’t
‘inside.’ Then, don’t you see, it must be outside.
Well, it is outside. It doesn’t exist till it gets outside.
All the differentiation, the distinction, the
qualities, which you and I value, are outside and
are created by means analogous to the means of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
art. In so far as people—any people, married or
otherwise—really give themselves adequately to
each other in love or in friendship, and impart
happiness with the gift, they give a self that is externalized,
objectified, and tangible—so to speak—in
some form of useful or beautiful activity,
which occasions no insatiable and consuming fever,
but the real joy of benefits given and received
and the delight of a loveliness that descends on the
contemplative eye like the free grace of God.”</p>

<p>“Your theory improves,” said Cornelia; “I
don’t wholly understand it; but it improves.”</p>

A THEORY OF HAPPINESS</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The foam was now running high up the beach.
I splashed straight through it, in spite of my shoes.
But Cornelia, lighter footed, danced with it like
a partner in some fantastic minuet, returning to
my side and my argument only when the creamy
gliding meander ebbed.</p>

<p>“A man’s power to impart his best self,” I said,
“depends on the woman’s power to receive it.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Cornelia, “all that any man,
even a genius, asks of his wife is intelligence
enough to appreciate him.”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “that isn’t true. That is going
by. There was a time when a husband thought of
himself as the pianist, and of his wife as standing
behind him to turn the pages of his music. But
nowadays we begin to think that the ideal concert
is by two performers on perfectly synchronized
independent instruments—not soloist and accompanist
but, say, organist and pianist, each as
important as the other.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” said Cornelia, “We shall never
expect that. But we do like our accompaniment to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
be applauded when we play well—and especially
when we don’t.”</p>

<p>“If there is one subject in the world,” I said,
veering a point, “about which I am more densely
ignorant than another, it is women, and what they
really like.”</p>

<p>“That’s quite true,” she lilted.</p>

<p>“But I knew a lady once—”</p>

<p>“Still another lady?”</p>

<p>“A most exquisite lady. And I often wondered
why, whenever ‘the idea of her life’ came into my
‘study of imagination’, I invariably saw her in a
setting, as if the setting were an organic part of
herself.”</p>

<p>“Well it is, isn’t it—if one puts a little effort
into it to make it right? It is in the setting—isn’t
it—that one has one’s opportunity to express
what you call the self. It is in one’s husband,
children, friends, and one’s home and habits and
things and so on.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but in the case of this lady there was a
curious point about the setting. Wherever she
was, seemed to be the centre of the picture. She
always seemed to frame.”</p>

<p>“What an attitudinizer she must have been!”</p>

<p>“She was not. It was only, I think, that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>
seemed to bring out and accentuate everything
near her that harmonized with her own vibrant and
articulate life. When I saw her in her drawing-room,
it framed her; and she appeared as fine and
finished as if she had stepped from a canvas of
Watteau’s. Her books and pictures and tapestries
became as intimately hers as her garments, so that
I have felt her almost visibly present in that room,
even when she was not there. Sometimes, in a
perverse mood, I have said, ‘This is all a pose’;
and, trying to go behind the elaborate expressiveness
of her artificial surroundings and to tease her
out of perfection, I have gone on rough walks with
her in woods and in the open, half hoping that she
might revert to the inarticulate pathos of Nature.
But the instant she stepped from the frame of art
she stepped into the frame of the landscape; the
greensward spread itself before her like Raleigh’s
cloak; groves offered themselves for a background;
and I finally concluded that if she came up out of
the sea, like Botticelli’s Cytherea, the sea would
clothe her and her pearly radiance appear but an
extension of the lustrous nacre of some deep-sea
shell.”</p>

<p>“You are fanciful,” said Cornelia.</p>

<p>“I am not fanciful,” I replied. “I express just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
as simply as I can with words my sense of the
quite blessed outwardness and availability of this
lady’s self. I don’t think she knew it, but—”</p>

<p>“But that shows how ignorant you are of
women,” she said, and swept me again sidelong
with her gray eyes.</p>

<p>“But whether she knew it or not,” I reasoned,
“she possesses a secret of communicating happiness—a
kind of happiness which I can only describe
as pure serenity at concert pitch. Perhaps
she was merely born in tune with some fine instrument
which the rest of us rarely hear. Perhaps she
is right, after all, in thinking of the art and discipline
of the traditional lady and the traditional
gentleman as the technique by which the true and
precious selves of our fellow creatures are most
likely to get themselves expressed.”</p>

<p>“I believe,” said Cornelia, “that your theory is
coming out rather well, and in time for tea.”</p>

<p>“My only reason for elaborating my theory is,
that it is based upon the practice of a lady whose
theory is infinitely surpassed by her art.”</p>

<p>“Is it, indeed?” she said.</p>

<p>“When I got the theory built, I was planning to
say that I should wish a daughter to choose for her
husband neither one of the sheik-monsters who of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</span>
late have been devouring our damsels, nor yet the
inexpressive and unmodified vestryman whom you
commended to our admiration this morning, but
rather a youth who should have a bit of the old
bachelor’s conception of what might be in the relation—an
old bachelor, I mean, who had known
in his own youth, an exquisite lady.”</p>

<p>“Why lug in the old bachelor?” Cornelia asked—a
little cruelly; for we were already at her door.</p>

<p>“Because,” I said, as she waited on the step for
my leave-taking, “because time and meditation
and the naturalistic novelists have convinced him
that, almost without a pang, he may resign to
Mr. O’Grady and the Colonel the similarities of
Judith and the lady, provided only that, from time
to time, he may refresh his memory and his senses
with the lady’s differences.”</p>

<p>“Meaning—”</p>

<p>“Why, meaning that the kind of man whom a
girl like Dorothy should choose should know that
the passion hymned by the naturalists is naught,
sheer naught—”</p>

<p>“You really mean that?”</p>

<p>“—in comparison with the quality of love
to be had in its high moments of general joyous
awareness of the entire radiant life of a fellow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span>
being—meeting his perceptions and recorded in
his imagination, clothed in color and motion and
talk and laughter and fresh air, the head turning
with frank gay light in the eyes, the lips parted in
speech, while the springing step goes rhythmically
over the wide-stretching earth under sunlight and
blue heavens.”</p>

<p>“It will be a long time,” said Cornelia, “before
Dorothy needs to trouble her head with that.
Meanwhile, we shall occupy ourselves with the
rudiments. Shall we see you at mail-time
to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “and we’ll take up Oliver’s case,
perhaps. There’s going to be a fine sunset.

THE REAL THING</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">As I entered the wood path through the birches
that run down to my own cottage, I thought I saw
a boyish youngish figure slipping among the trees
to the eastward. A moment later, I met Dorothy
walking demurely up the path, with a book in her
hand, closed upon one finger.</p>

<p>“Watching the sun set?” I asked, diplomatically.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “watching him disappear.”</p>

<p>“Watching whom disappear?” I inquired, being
invited.</p>

<p>“Oh, a boy that I like. We’ve been reading one
of mother’s new books. It’s about a girl, Deirdre,
who didn’t want to marry a king, because there
was a boy that she liked very much better—in
all ways. And so they ran away and lived in the
woods—and died happily.”</p>

<p>“Oho!” I exclaimed. “I suspect the happiness
of their death has been greatly exaggerated. It
seemed to me rather dreadful. It’s James
Stephens’s version, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Dorothy, and turning the golden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span>
dusk of her eyes with a sweet young gravity full
upon mine, she added: “How old was my mother
when you first knew her?”</p>

<p>“About your age, Dorothy. Why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Was she very different then—from the way
she is now?”</p>

<p>“She was quite a bit like you, then,” I said,
“if I remember. But why do you ask?”</p>

<p>“Because,” she said, “she has marked the
loveliest passage in this book. And I can’t understand
why, because she isn’t like that now—not
at all like that now.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t like what?”</p>

<p>“I mean,” said Dorothy with perfect lucidity,
“that this passage expresses just the way this boy
and I feel. Shall I read it to you?”</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t be quite nice,” I suggested,
“would it, Dorothy? Good-bye!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” she agreed; but as she moved
toward the house, she turned and called after me:
“But if you want to read it, you can find it on page
one-hundred-and-forty.”</p>

<p>In my own copy of James Stephens’s <em>Deirdre</em>,
I have marked, on page one-hundred-and-forty,
this passage:—</p>

<p>“Lacking him, what could be returned to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span>
her? Her hands went cold and her mouth dry as
she faced such a prospect.</p>

<p>“The youth who was hers. Who had no terrors
for her! Who was her equal in years and frolic!
She could laugh with him and at him. She could
chide him and love him. She could give to him
and withhold. She could be his mother as well as
his wife. She could annoy him and forgive him.
For between them there was such an equality of
time and rights that neither could dream of
mastery or feel a grief against the other. He was
her beloved, her comrade, the very red of her
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>heart, and her choice choice.”</p>

THE EDUCATION OF DAUGHTERS</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">I have always looked with admiring astonishment
on parents who have daughters on their
minds, and yet are not broken by the responsibility;
and next to the weight of immediate responsibility
for a daughter I should place the
burden, which some mothers still take upon themselves,
of choosing a daughter-in-law. In my
callous moods, I say that the ordinary run of
children make as good matches for themselves as
they deserve, and that they had better be left to
their own devices. But if I were a parent and had
successfully brought up to the “magnetic age”
two such delightful children as Cornelia’s, I suspect
that I myself shouldn’t be able to resist
attempting to be a Providence to them. Over a
daughter, especially, I suppose I should make a
particular fool of myself. I should probably try
to keep her for the most part like a bird-of-paradise
in a cage, and when I let her out, should
endeavor to control her flight by “a thread of
my own heart’s weaving.” And I am positive
that any youth who presented himself as a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
candidate for her hand would, unless he were the
possessor of incredible perfections, have desperate
difficulty in winning mine.</p>

<p>I did feel reasonably competent, nevertheless,
to discuss eligible sons-in-law with Cornelia. The
young men of to-day are not notably better or
worse than the young men of twenty years ago,
nor is the problem of choice among them essentially
altered. I know a good man when I see
him, as well as Cornelia does. But what is a good
daughter or a good daughter-in-law nowadays?
It is a horrid question. It leads one into the
hot air of clashing ideals.</p>

<p>With respect to girls, I admit at once that I am
in a state of confusion and uncertainty, and that
I may appear to be in a place where the light is
dim, not merely because girls, between the period
of George Sand and the period of Miss Amy
Lowell, are said to have changed rapidly and
essentially, but also because in the vast and
engrossing literature of this subject I have remained
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">homo unius libri</i>, a man of one book—of
strictly limited experience. As I remarked to
Cornelia in all humility, only a day or two ago,
if there is one thing of which I am more densely
ignorant than another, it is women, including<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
girls. If I were suddenly called upon to indicate
to a son my notion of the ideal woman for a lifelong
companion, I fear that I should not get
beyond faltering forth a vague and most likely
quite unpersuasive description of the virtues of
Cornelia; and he, if he were as acute as I should
like a son of my own to be, would doubtless
inform me that it isn’t the virtues of Cornelia
that take me, but her charm, which I don’t understand.
At any rate, my personal curiosity was so
happily and completely arrested by my first discovery
of perfection that, in the twenty years
which have elapsed since that time, I have never
felt impelled to explore any further.</p>

<p>I recall, for example, that when a few years
ago I visited England in order to look up the
baptismal record of an Elizabethan lawyer, I
met on shipboard a vivacious young Frenchwoman
who had compassion on my obviously
lonely state and proposed one day that we make
a couple of constitutional turns around the deck.
At the end of the first turn, during which I had
dallied a bit with the weather in my ingenious
American fashion, she shrugged her shoulders—that
is, I suppose she did, for she was very French—and
exclaimed, “<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Allons donc, causons de la<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
femme</i> (Well, now, let’s talk about women)!” I
had read somewhere or other that Frenchwomen
excel in the light discussion of serious themes and
general ideas; and if she had proposed that we
discuss palæography or epigraphy, I should have
been delighted to observe how French feminine
wit handles such subjects. But in the face of
the topic proposed, I was aghast. I had no intention
of talking Cornelia over with a perfect
stranger; and feigning dizziness from the motion
of the ship, I rather abruptly “saved myself,” as
the French say, and went below.</p>

<p>It is, curiously enough, Cornelia herself who in
these later years is driving me to reopen the subject,
investigate it, and “take a stand.” I haven’t,
till lately, felt myself to be in an uncertain position
or in a dim light, but rather in a very certain
position and at the radiant centre of light. I
don’t wish to change my stand. Neither, of course,
does she wish me to change it. Yet, if I alter, her
own inflexibility will have been the prime mover.</p>

<p>It comes about in this way: she goes into the
country as religious people go into a retreat—to
escape from dusty contacts with the bustling
democratic world, to collect her soul, to fortify
her principles, and to renew her vows of allegiance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>
to the conceptions of the good and the beautiful
which she inherits from several generations of
ancestors accustomed to giving the tone to the
society in which they lived. It is utterly impossible
to think of Cornelia at present as a <em>grande
dame</em>—she is too young, there is too much of
the morning clinging to her; and I cannot bear
to dwell on the possibility of its ever deserting
her; yet in the treasonable hours of the imagination
I do occasionally steal forward on the straight
highway of time, and I can see that, thirty years
hence, if she holds her course, if she fulfills her
destiny, she will be a beautiful and proud old
lady, still giving the law to her children and to her
grandchildren—what people call a <em>grande dame</em>.</p>

<p>But the tide of democratic vulgarity is running
into the country havens and stealing insidiously
into the securest retreats. One’s own friends and
neighbors are tainted with it. One’s own husband
brings a whiff of it up from the city at the week-end.
One’s own children, in spite of all segregation
and antiseptic precautions, show a mild
infection with it in their speech, in their manners,
and even in their tastes. One doesn’t compromise
with it. One “stands firm”; but one
stands ever more and more alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>I admire Cornelia’s ability to stand alone
against the world, against her own times, and
against the practice of the city and the tyrannies
of fashion; and, when she is wholly right, as I
think she often is, it is the pleasantest thing
imaginable for me to stand with her. But I am
beginning, at an advanced age, to develop skepticism,
and to look with an uneasy skeptical eye
upon a rectitude of taste which isolates one too
sharply from one’s own flesh and blood—such
“pure and eloquent blood” as speaks in the faces
of Cornelia’s children. When she expects me to
side instantaneously with her against the budding
ferment of her own son and daughter, I hesitate.
I reluct, like a man called from the roadside to
leave the sweet intoxication of an orchard in May.
I become curious and loath to close the windows
of apprehension to the rumors and fragrance of
another springtime.</p>

<p>On the morning—Friday it was—after our
windy walk by the lake, Cornelia, contrary to
my expectation, did not appear at mail time
under the big elm which shades our little grove
of R.F.D. boxes. This was a surprise, because
she had virtually agreed to be there and she
habitually performs with precision whatever she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
has agreed to do. Later in the day, however, I
learned that her husband had unexpectedly
arrived in a hydroplane, with an officer in the
naval flying corps, and that he would stay over
Sunday, which was Dorothy’s birthday. We
seldom make calls in our summer community,
except, as we say, “on intimation.” Accordingly
I waited for an intimation. All day Saturday,
to my increasing wonder, there was nothing but
silence from His Excellency’s household, and, in
the phrase which high usage has now made classic,
“damned little of that.” But I quite anticipated
a birthday party on Sunday—for Oliver Senior
makes much of these occasions—and probably a
fire on the beach in the evening, with the latest
gossip and best stories of the city. There was no
party, and there was no fire.</p>

<p>On Monday I went down my path to the mail
boxes with acute curiosity. The carrier’s Ford
had apparently broken down on the mountain,
for he was nowhere in sight. I found Cornelia
sitting alone on the bench under the elm; the
other pilgrims, weary of waiting, had scattered
along the marshy lakeside in search of lady’s-slippers,
which were abundant this year. She
was all in white, and she sat with her bronze-gold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</span>
head leaning against the gray trunk, and
with one hand, lying listlessly across her knee,
holding her soft white hat. If I were not afraid
of being called bookish and pedantic, I should
admit that as I approached she reminded me
of Ariadne in Naxos; as it is, I content myself
with remarking that she seemed a little languid.
She did not rise.</p>

<p>I observed the point, because listlessness is not
her “note.”</p>

<p>“I hoped you would come,” she said.</p>

<p>“It’s a lovely morning, isn’t it,” I exclaimed,
in a sudden awareness of the truth of what I
was saying.</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t a lovely morning,” she replied.
“It’s a horrid morning. Come and sit down. I
want to be comforted.” Looking into her cool
gray eyes, I saw that I had been mistaken. It
wasn’t a lovely morning; there was a cloud in
the sky.</p>

<p>“You, comforted?” I said incredulously, and
seated myself at the other end of the bench, for I
felt my hopeless inexperience with Ariadnes. “I
thought you were always happy. Where is Oliver?
I heard he came Friday night, but I haven’t
seen hoof or horn of him.”</p>

<p>Cornelia looked out for a moment silently over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</span>
the deep, still, intense blueness of our lake, mirroring
the blueness of the morning sky. I suppose
in that rapt moment—I haven’t seen her look
more purely poetic in years—she was deciding
whether it was her duty to tell me a loyal lie or
whether she might relax and tell the simple truth.
As she was in one of her rare moments of languor,
she decided for the truth.</p>

<p>“I am vexed with Oliver. I sent him back to
town on Saturday. I told him that I didn’t wish
to see him again this summer.”</p>

<p>“Why, Cornelia!” I cried, “What in the world
has Oliver done? Is it proper for me to hear? Has
he been flirting with his secretary? Or has he
been beating you? Or what?”</p>

<p>“He has been beating me.” Cornelia dabbed
at the corner of one eye with her handkerchief;
and I imagine there may have been some occasion
for it, though I did not see it. She held her lower
lip for an instant compressed under her perfect
teeth. I noticed these things because in twenty
years’ acquaintance I had never witnessed them
before—but once, and that was in the dark
backward and abysm of time. Then she smiled
faintly and repeated:—</p>

<p>“Yes, he has beaten me. Dreadfully.”</p>

<p>“The monster! What have you done to merit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
blows? You don’t look bruised, Cornelia. Now
that you have wept, you look like a calla lily
after rain.”</p>

<p>“What have I done? I have done nothing but
try to bring up my children as children should
be brought up. And I am bruised and beaten.
Oliver has betrayed me. I am fond of Oliver. I
am his best friend. Oliver is—Oliver is a good
deal of a dear—in his way. But it does seem as
if, when it comes to the children, he acted like
an irresponsible boy. Oliver is fifty-two. He acts as
if he were fifteen, or as if he wished that he were.”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt that he does,” I said, “and I
have always thought that his boyish gusto was a
positive element in his charm, and the quality
especially which makes his children so fond of
him. But tell me, now, what he has done, and
I’ll try to judge him as he deserves.”</p>

<p>Cornelia began doubtfully and far away from
the main point, in accordance with the manual
of tactics for women.</p>

<p>“Well, first of all,” she said, “he came up here
in an aeroplane. I have forbidden him to fly. At
his age and with his family, he has no right to
take such hazards merely to amuse himself.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” I said, “but you know that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
like Oliver because he is the sort of person who
does take hazards. If he weren’t, you would
despise him.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” she replied. “If there were real
occasion for it, I should despise him if he were
not the first to risk his life. But he does it now—and
these other things, I am convinced—mainly
because he knows how much I dislike them. I
don’t see what possesses him.”</p>

<p>“What other things does he do, Cornelia?
Oliver is at one of the ‘dangerous ages.’ And
perhaps his children are beginning to influence
him. You mustn’t forget that Dorothy and
Oliver Junior have reached an age at which offspring
frequently have a very unsettling effect
upon their parents.”</p>

<p>“Well, listen. You know how much I dislike
what people call ‘the modern girl’ and all her
works and ways?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And you know how hard I have tried to keep
Dorothy in her old-fashioned sweetness and
innocence?”</p>

<p>“I don’t see what there is old-fashioned in
Dorothy,” I said. “But she is sweet. I supposed
God had made her so, and that the work couldn’t<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
easily be changed, and that all you had to do
was to stand aside and watch her blossoming.
But since you say that has been a trial, I must
believe that you have been tried by it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and so does Oliver—I mean, he knows
perfectly that it isn’t easy for me to keep the
right influences here and the wrong ones away.
But what do you suppose occurred to him as the
most appropriate birthday present that he could
send up here by express to his daughter, the day
before he came last week? An expensive knicker-outfit,
a handsome cigarette-case, and a big package
of his own cigarettes.”</p>

<p>“Oliver has to have his little jest.”</p>

<p>“Little jest, indeed!” retorted Cornelia almost
grimly. “When Dorothy opened the bundle, of
course I supposed that Oliver had enclosed the
cigarettes for his own use. But Dorothy said,
‘No, mother, they are for me. Father promised
them to me on my birthday.’ She opened the
box, and there was a poem from Oliver, addressed,
‘To my daughter Dorothy with her first box of
cigarettes,’ with a lot of rigmarole warning her
against the excess of smoking more than one at a
time! I thought he had gone crazy, and I was
so angry that I snatched the cigarettes and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
case from her and threw them into the fireplace.”</p>

<p>“If you take the jest seriously,” I said, “I
don’t blame you for being perturbed. I haven’t
any clear moral principle on this point. Many
girls do smoke; and I think we shall ultimately
have to concede that smoking isn’t a ‘sex function.’
But smoking and Dorothy don’t go together,
in my feeling for the fitness of things. It
seems like offering snuff to Viola or a Manila
cigar to Rosalind. (You ought not to forget, by
the way, that those two girls did wear knickers.)
But smoking—why, I should as soon think of
offering a plug of tobacco to you, Cornelia.”</p>

<p>“Ugh! Don’t be disgusting,” she pleaded.</p>

<p>“I’m not disgusting. I am only expressing my
sense of the immeasurable gulf that lies between
you and anything of questionable taste. But go
on with your story.”</p>

<p>“Well, Oliver arrived that night. When I
asked him what he meant by the performance, he
laughed in that infectious, irresistibly disarming
way he has, and said, ‘Oh, I have been reading
Heywood Broun on the care and nurture of children.
The young man has ideas. He thinks the
way to equip youth for the battle of life is to gird
upon them the sword of early experience, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span>
buckler of knowingness, and the whole armor of
sophistication. And I’ve decided to turn over
a new leaf and meet my children halfway. Treat
them like equals, instead of like superior beings.
Dorothy will learn to smoke next fall, when she
goes to college. It may be the only useful thing
she will ever learn there. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Qui sait?</i> But if she
waits till then, she will learn with a parcel of silly
goslings who will think it is devilish. Let’s try
the effect of having her begin now at the domestic
fireside with her own father and mother, who don’t
think it devilish.”</p>

<p>I could seem to see a certain reckless experimental
method in Oliver’s madness—as in the
serious proposal of some other reformers for
“communal bathing” in the household, as an antidote
to precocious sexual curiosity. It was an
experiment which I should be willing to have
tried on a dog. It had something in common, indeed,
with an undeveloped notion of my own on
the use of moral antitoxins. But I could also see
that Cornelia saw nothing of the sort. So I merely
asked, “And what did you say?”</p>

<p>“I said,” she replied, “that Dorothy’s mother
did think it devilish—that Dorothy had never
seen her mother smoking and never would. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
laughed again and said, ‘Then she will never learn
to do it like a lady.’ I inquired whether he were
incapable of distinguishing between what is permissible
in a man, perhaps pardonable in his
typist, and what is undesirable in his seventeen-year-old
daughter. He reminded me that three
fourths of the ladies he knows smoke, and that
Russian women, French women, and English
women can’t understand why we make a moral
issue of it. I said, ‘So much the worse for them.
I am sick of having something obviously bad in
America excused merely because something obviously
worse exists elsewhere.’ He said, ‘Cornelia,
you are a Little American. You are out of step.’
And I lost my temper, and exclaimed, ‘Oliver, you
are a great idiot! Dorothy hasn’t smoked yet, and
she wouldn’t think of smoking now, if she hadn’t
a fool for a father.’”</p>

FLAGS OF REVOLT</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">As this was the first and remains the only occasion
in my life on which any married woman has
ever revealed to me any serious altercation between
herself and her husband,—though I have
been informed by others that such revelations are
not uncommon,—I was astounded.</p>

<p>“Why, my dear Cornelia!” I exclaimed, “that
was a fighting word. Was it then that Oliver
beat you?”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered with a partially reassuring
smile, “I wish he had. Oliver sulks when he is
angry. I flash out what I feel, and have it over
with. Oliver sulks and plots some revenge—some
ingenious, horrid little revenge that he knows
will make me furious.”</p>

<p>I gasped inwardly—if one can do that; but I
tried to play the part of the unruffled confessor. I
was learning so much that was new to me about
happy family life. “Well, what did he do next?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“He took a box of cigars and a novel and went
up to his room, to bed. At six o’clock in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
morning he got up and roused the household,
apparently in the jolliest humor, ringing all
through the house the big dinner-bell that we use
to call the children from the woods. He made
Dorothy put on her new knickers, and got the car
out, and drove off to town with the children, ‘for
a lark,’ he said. They came back about noon, and
drove up to the door, and honked. I went out;
and there was Dorothy in her knickers on the
front seat with her father, both of them smoking,
and Dorothy with her hair—her lovely soft hair—bobbed
above her ears, and her neck shaved
like a convict’s. I could have cried—either with
grief or with rage. And Oliver, simply bubbling
with joy, called out, ‘I’ve met them halfway,
Cornelia darling!’ Wasn’t he horrid? Wasn’t he
perfectly horrid? I didn’t cry. But Oliver went
back to New York by the afternoon train. And
now you know why there was no birthday party
last night.”</p>

BLOOM</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">“Cornelia,” I said after a moment of intense
meditation, “I think—I am not sure, but I
think you are making a mistake.”</p>

<p>“I am sure!” she retorted. “I am not making
a mistake. I know perfectly well what I am doing.
I have never been more certain about anything in
my life than that Oliver is wrong—utterly wrong.
What mistake am I making?”</p>

<p>“You are making the mistake which nine
tenths of the good people of our generation are
making in dealing with their own children. You
are making the mistake of trying to suppress the
symptoms instead of diagnosing the disease.
Knickers and the rest are symptoms. Of what?
You ought to be thinking about that, but you are
not. Cigarettes and bobbed hair are flags of revolt.
You are interested only in capturing the flags and
burning them. But what is the revolt about?
That is what you ought to be thinking about;
and you aren’t thinking about it at all.”</p>

<p>“I am thinking about it,” she protested. “I
am thinking about nothing else. I am not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
simpleton. Personally I do abominate bobbed
hair and cigarettes, but I am not afraid of them.
What I am afraid of is the disease, or the revolt,
of which they are the signals. It is the state of
mind which goes along with them. It is the precious
and irrecoverable things that disappear
when these things appear.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite follow you.”</p>

<p>“I mean the sweetness and freshness of young
girls—their bloom. Don’t you care, don’t you
really care, even you—Oh, how shall I make you
understand what I feel about the preciousness of
the bloom on things, and on boys and girls who
have been brought up happily and wisely in the
right surroundings! Ever since I can remember I
have had the strangest ecstatic sense about everything
that has just come new into the world—dewy
things, roses and morning glories early in
the morning, little bits of babies, a pear tree all a
soft mist of white blossoms, the slender little new
moon in a green sky low in the west over treetops
at nightfall, robin’s eggs, just peeped at, in a lilac
bush, the rosy-white tips of old grapevines, the
silvery mist of plums before they are picked—anything,
everything lovely before dust or heat
has touched it and before anyone, anyone, has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
pawed it over. When I was a young girl my heart
fairly ached with tenderness for this quality in
things—and with a passionate desire to preserve
it. When one grows older, the desire doesn’t
die out; it becomes only intenser, sharper, with
years, till it goes through one like pain. And as I
was walking over here this morning, I kept thinking
of all these things that have it—have the
bloom; and of my little Dorothy—who had it,
till her own father brushed it off.”</p>

<p>Cornelia uttered this speech swiftly and with a
kind of soft, eager, glowing sincerity which terribly
disquieted my judgment. But I somehow felt
that I had slipped into the position of advocate
for the rest of Cornelia’s family, which stood at
the moment in dire need of advocacy. I smothered
my instinctive emotional response, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>“Nonsense! What you value in Dorothy can’t
be brushed off. Bloom is only the transient breath
of qualities that extend in her from rind to core,
like the red in a blood orange. You are reveling in
a mood, or you yourself would recognize that
bloom—intactness—is preserved only by unsuccessful,
undiscovered, sterile things. If it remains,
it becomes a badge of uselessness. It is meant
only for a brief seasonal show, which we may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
enjoy while it lasts; but it is silly to grieve over
it. Other beauties follow—the full moon, and
birds that break the lovely blue shells to bits and
sing. Dorothy is breaking through her shell.
That is all.”</p>

<p>Cornelia sighed: “If it only were! But you
don’t know anything about the revolution that
takes place in a girl’s mind, and in her character,
the moment she puts on the badge of those
who have ceased to care for ‘intactness!’”</p>

<p>“I’m not sure that I do.”</p>

<p>“Well, the next time that you see three girls
with bobbed hair and knickers—abominable
word!—and with cigarettes in their mouths,
edge up to them and overhear if you can what
they are talking about: some unmentionable novel,
some unprintable verse, some unspeakable ideas of
some outrageous ‘reformer,’ something revolting
that is sanctioned in Europe but, alas, has not
yet been sanctioned here, some silly ‘martyr’ who
has got into jail for some offence against decency,
some crazy girl who has ruined herself as completely
as the heroine of the latest novel. Perhaps
you will hear them discussing what I overheard a
group of our modern maidens debating not long
ago—whether if a man and a woman registered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span>
at a hotel as husband and wife, the laws of this
state would not recognize them as such.”</p>

<p>“These are ‘strong’ topics,” I said. “I don’t
think they are the only topics that girls with
bobbed hair discuss, though they doubtless are
discussed by girls with bobbed hair—and also
by some girls whose hair reaches to their knees.
But what you are always forgetting, Cornelia, is
that life is full of strong topics. We can’t get away
from them or keep them from the knowledge of
our children, unless we are ready to abolish eyes
and ears. At the most, we can only cover them
over a little and keep still about them. I think
you fall into the same fallacy regarding the conversational
discussion of them which you fell
into regarding the discussion of them in current
fiction. You conceive it an error of the first magnitude
to admit the existence of evils which every
one knows exist. What I should try to ascertain,
if I edged up to a group of ‘modern’ girls in conclave
on these themes, is the point of view from
which they were speaking—the amount of common
sense which they were bringing to bear upon
the vices and follies of their contemporaries.”</p>

<p>Cornelia likes the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad hominem</i> form of argument.
“If you had a daughter of seventeen,” she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
said, “should you enjoy seeing her blow the smoke
through her lips and hearing her wisely consider
the legal consequences of registering at a hotel
under the names of ‘John Doe and Wife’?”</p>

<p>“If I had a daughter,” I replied cautiously, “I
have a sentimental notion that I should like to
have one who at the age of seventeen would feel
the æsthetic impropriety of smoking, and who at
any rate would not feel her nerves on edge without
tobacco. But suppose Heaven visited the sins of
the father upon the child by giving me a—well,
a ‘modern’ daughter. If my daughter, after
emitting the smoke, ejaculated the word ‘Geese!’
with a good accent, and a clear cool sound of conviction,
and a kind of contemptuous remoteness
from Greenwich Village problems, why I think I
should feel mightily reassured. I should be positively
glad to have heard her express her mind on
this strong topic. And if tobacco helped her to
express her mind, as it helps me to express mine,
I might even feel mildly grateful to the tobacco.”</p>

<p>“You know you would not,” said Cornelia.</p>

<p>“Perhaps you are right. But at any rate, I can
conceive of no person more properly subject for
satire than a man with the fifth cigar of the
morning in his mouth taking up the battle axe to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
make war against the first cigarette of his wife or
daughter.”</p>

<p>“You are merely talking for argument. I hate
you when you do that. You get so far away from
me that I can’t talk with you.”</p>

<p>“No,” I insisted, “I am not talking for argument.
I am pleading in behalf of your sex, for
equality of access to the good things of life, whatever
we may finally decide are the good things. I
am pleading for a little moral justice toward your
sex, and for the necessity, if there is to be justice,
of a little discrimination. You don’t seem to
discriminate at all among your ‘modern’ girls. It
simply isn’t true that they are all discussing suppressed
novels and illicit love affairs. Many of
them are far more interested in horseback riding,
duck-shooting, hockey, golf, or hiking to Yellowstone
Park. I am not sure what our girls are going
to get out of their political activities; but I know
what they are going to get out of their athletic
activities. I am an uncompromising and enthusiastic
adherent of athletic life for women—not
Country Club women alone, but all women.”</p>

<p>“I approve of women exercising,” assented
Cornelia, “if it can be done in a nice way. I
don’t care for Marathon runners and champion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</span>
swimmers and that vulgar display of limbs in
the newspapers.”</p>

<p>“Cornelia,” I said, “you use the word ‘nice’
too much; you overwork it. Your son told me the
other day that, whenever he mentions a new girl
acquaintance in your presence, you have only one
question about her: ‘Is she nice?’ ‘It gets on my
nerves,’ he says, ‘to hear that everlasting: Is she
nice?—Is she nice?—Is she nice?—till I don’t
care whether she is nice or not; and I feel like
saying, No, she is horrid; but she sings like an
angel, and she dances like a wave, and she makes
a sparkling quip, and she has brains of her own,
and she is attractive, and she is reasonable, and
she is a good sport, and she doesn’t squall when
we get caught in the rain. I don’t go around asking
girls whether they are nice. How should I
know? Mother means well and is perfectly fine
herself, and all that. But somehow, you know, it
strikes me as kind of nasty for a fellow to be always
thinking whether a girl is nice.’ And there, my
dear Cornelia, you get a bit of the spirit of the
younger generation, which is, I think, essentially
sounder and healthier than the perpetual incensing
of ‘purity’ by some earlier generations.”</p>

<p>“In what way is it sounder and healthier?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</span></p>

<p>“Why, I mean that it isn’t the presence of
sexual characteristics and impulses in an adolescent
or in an adult that renders him or her ‘not
nice.’ That is a part of nature and of humanity.
What is not nice is perpetual preoccupation with
these impulses. And perpetual preoccupation with
them results from isolation with them, and exclusion
from anything else of equal or superior interest.
I am convinced that many of your ‘modern’
girls are discovering that fact for themselves.
And it is because they dread the bondage and
guess the degradation of confinement to a single
instinct—it is because of this that they are
groping so eagerly for other interests. For many
of them, bobbed hair and cigarettes are signs
that they are filling and freeing their minds with
advertising, real estate, journalism, medicine,
law, field geology, geographical exploration, and
political organization.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV-3">IV<br>
CAREERS FOR WOMEN</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">“Is that the sort of woman that you would have
married,” said Cornelia, “if you had married?”</p>

<p>“Let us not discuss the woman I would have
married. Or rather let me remind you of this
about her: the reason why the woman I would
have married decided not to marry me was her
clear-eyed perception, after some tears and emotional
stress, that love was not enough to live
on: that what I could offer her was not enough to
make up a life for the many-sided being that she
knew herself to be.”</p>

<p>I paused a moment for a response. But Cornelia
kept silence, looking out over the blue water. I
continued:—</p>

<p>“If a girl is so placed in the world that she can
find expression for the versatility of human
nature in a really satisfactory domestic life and
really satisfactory society and luxurious travel and
beautiful surroundings and the fine things in
literature and art and the rearing of really superior
children—why, then she may not be tempted at
all by advertising and real estate. But can’t you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
see, Cornelia, that for the immense majority of
girls the only way of getting anything but their
conjugal and maternal capacities valued or expressed,
and the only way of getting even their
feminine charms to a suitable market lies through
some such avenues as I have mentioned?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Cornelia, “I know girls are going
in for these things more and more; that is why
I am so much worried about my son. I don’t
want him to become interested in that sort of
girl. She wouldn’t make him happy. She
wouldn’t be a good wife for him. Yet, just now,
he seems to have a mania for ‘girls that do things.’
I know it’s the fashion for girls to ‘do things’ nowadays;
but don’t you hate to see them doing
them?”</p>

<p>“I truly do not. I admit that ‘careers’ for
women are still in a more or less experimental
stage. But the results from the ancient experiment
in keeping women out of careers are all in.
I am curious to see the results of the more recent
experiment. Professional men, as life wears on,
come to look upon a career, with all its burdens,
as literally the one indispensable element, without
which existence would be intolerable. For
ages, men have lied to their sweethearts; have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>
deceived them into thinking sweethearts and
wives are the indispensable elements in the happiness
of men. But it really is not so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“No. And the girls themselves are finding it
out, and are very sensibly claiming a share in the
substantial satisfactions of life.”</p>

<p>“You have no imagination. You don’t understand.
It’s so simple, so perfectly simple. Substantial
satisfactions for men are not substantial
satisfactions for women. That is all there is to
it. The things that please you and fill your lives
are sawdust to us—after the first novelty wears
off; and they leave our hearts aching and burning.
I am certain there isn’t a mature woman in business
who wouldn’t admit, if she were honest, that
if the choice were open, she would choose even a
moderately successful marriage in preference to a
brilliant success in business. They are making a
mistake—such a mistake. I am sure that, in
their hearts, they know from the outset that it
isn’t what their hearts desire.”</p>

<p>“About the hearts of young girls,” I admitted,
“I know next to nothing. I am still curious about
them because I have heard so much about them.
But the only occasion on which I ever asked a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
girl for her heart, she gave me a stone. And I
believe that, far oftener than most men suspect,
the place in the pectoral cavity of women assigned
to the heart is occupied by some far harder substance.
You remember that lovely creature in
Balzac whose lover overheard her in solitude exclaiming,
‘My God! O my God!’; and the words
seemed to him to come from the uttermost depths
of her heart and made him love her more passionately
than ever, till he learned that she had merely
been anxious about her stock speculations—and
that the deep suspiration really came from the
woman’s purse.”</p>

<p>Cornelia was not impressed by this reference
to Balzac. She has a capable business head herself,
and manages her property, which is considerable,
with more judgment than her husband
displays. She ignored the malice in my speech
and merely remarked:—</p>

<p>“A nice woman need not be a fool in money
matters.”</p>

<p>“No,” I continued, “and many of them aren’t.
That is why I believe many of them are not making
a mistake but following a real vocation when
they turn to business. I don’t know much about
their hearts, but I have had extensive opportunity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
to observe their brains, and, in some
respects, I am tremendously impressed by them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we have some common-sense among us,”
she agreed.</p>

<p>“It isn’t common-sense so much,” I corrected,
“in which girls excel. It is a special faculty of
their sex, a kind of darting velocity of mind,
which men of other races, the Jews and the
Chinese, for example, display more abundantly
than Anglo-Saxon men. In manual deftness, in
celerity of apprehension, in executive readiness,
in a kind of swift practical insight, in flying straight
to the point, girls and young women are proving
dangerous competitors. They remind me of turtle
doves, which, you know, have two very different
notes. They coo and coo in the woods, till you
think that a mournful amorousness is all they are
good for; but if you start them up, they go ‘piet,
piet, piet’ at ninety miles an hour to their next
destination.”</p>

<p>“Oliver is quicker than I am,” said Cornelia,
whose generalizations on the virtues rest largely
on observation of her own family, “but Dorothy
is quicker than her brother; and I am quicker than
you are. Yes, I think you are right. Girls are
quicker. But quickness isn’t very important in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
itself. The important thing is to know where
one is going.”</p>

<p>“Girls show,” I proceeded, “very many of them,
what the advocates of mental tests recognize as
officer quality. I suspect that, if the draft were
made universal, and if the army tests were applied
to all the women in the country, not only would
the disgrace of our moron percentage be greatly
abated, but ninety-nine per cent of the men
would be obliged to serve in the ranks. Among
women, there is an immediacy of reaction to
stimuli, a freedom from dubitation, subordinate
considerations, and inhibiting afterthoughts,
which make them invaluable members of a General
Staff, when the General Staff is infested with
doubting Thomases, Hamlets, and authorities on
red tape.”</p>

<p>“If you think that,” inquired Cornelia, “why
don’t you, and why doesn’t Oliver, give more
attention to what I tell him is right?”</p>

<p>“Because,” I replied, “we are harassed by subordinate
considerations and afterthoughts. But
that is just what makes women want to get their
hands on things and manage them. I am astounded
every day to discover in how many big
businesses and even political organizations there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
is some woman, who has perhaps risen from a
stenographic position, sitting in with the chiefs of
the concern at the centre of the web and actually
telling the ‘big wigs’ what to do—actually ruling
the whirlwind and directing the storm.”</p>

<p>After this speech, I glanced at Cornelia to see
whether she would admit to herself her own master
passion, her suppressed desire. I could see that
she was doing something which she ordinarily
would no more think of doing in my presence
than of doing up her hair: she was reflecting.</p>

<p>“Possibly,” she conceded.</p>

<p>“Not possibly,” I pursued, “but certainly. All
women crave mastery, beginning with the government
of their own husbands; and their happiness,
after the first feigning delight of amorous surrender,
is to extend their jurisdiction, to enlarge
the limits of their empire. It is the quality that
makes queens. It is the quality that made Elizabeth
and not Burleigh the ruler of England, and
Catherine, not her minister,—whoever he was,—ruler
of all the Russias. It is a quality which you
yourself possess, my dear Cornelia, in abundance,
only you haven’t an adequate throne to display
it on; and so, instead of sending Raleigh to South
America for galleons of treasure or telling the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
president of your company which railroad to buy
next, you have to take it out in sending Oliver
back to the city in disgrace because he has had
Dorothy’s hair bobbed.”</p>

<p>“How I hate him!” cried Cornelia, as if still
nursing the bitterness of defeat.</p>

<p>“Really?” I asked, in a momentary flutter of
hope.</p>

<p>“But if queens feel as miserable as I do,” she
added, “since I have had to discipline him, I
don’t wish to be a queen.”</p>

<p>“You have no choice,” I murmured.</p>

<p>“But here comes the mail,” she exclaimed, rising
suddenly and putting on her hat. “Come! Let’s
go and meet it.”</p>

<p>My secret hope sank like a stone into cold
depths of resignation.</p>

<p>“All right,” I assented sadly; “but why such
eagerness for the mail this morning?”</p>

<p>“Why, I am hoping,” she lilted, “I am hoping,
of course, for a letter from Oliver, you idiot!”</p>

ENNUI IN THE PROVINCES</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The smooth order of Cornelia’s life was interrupted
on New Year’s Eve by a distressing
occurrence which I—which all of us who possess
a rudimentary sense of tact—insist on calling
an accident. It was not the sort of thing that I
had ever thought of as likely to intrude upon the
felicity of that household. My own convulsive
unuttered response to the shock was: “That it
should have happened to them!” But as it, or
something very like it, actually happens every
day,—once, twice, three times a day all through
the year in every big city,—there was really no
reason for assuming that they would remain indefinitely
immune. The circumstance which seemed
at the moment to point the accident with a piercing
significance, a chilling personal meaning for
us, was, I suppose, the mere coincidence that
we were arguing in the abstract about just such
occurrences when the brutal reality of the thing
burst in among us with the effrontery of a bandit
in a Pullman car. Of course it admits of the
natural explanation which I shall give, leading up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span>
to the mishap in the order of my own approach.</p>

<p>Cornelia spends the winter months in the city,
in a desirable apartment near the lower end of
the Park—an apartment so spacious and so
desirable that an old New Yorker once amused
himself at my small-town ideas by asking me to
guess the annual rental. As her children, Dorothy
and Oliver Junior,—the centre of her summer
solicitude,—are at their preparatory schools
except during the holidays, she devotes this
season to her women friends, to her husband, and
to her husband’s friends. I group in this way the
people whom she entertains, first, because she has
no men friends who are not her husband’s friends,
and, second, because her husband has an endless
string of interesting official and unofficial personages
whom he gets up—or brings up—from
Washington for conferences or for exhibitionary
or other mysterious diplomatic purposes.</p>

<p>As an ancient admirer—to put it discreetly—who
has sunk through the incalculable accidents
of life to the level of an educational counselor
or referee, I confess that I find Cornelia just a
shade more perfectly herself in the country, where
she is comparatively alone with the children and
nature and her books, than in the city, where, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span>
my occasional expeditions, I see her but seldom
and then usually so beset with husband, friends,
and personages that there is little opportunity for
the long educational tête-à-têtes of the summer.
Of these conversations, be it admitted once for
all, the secret excitement is in listening for the
occasional lilt of Cornelia’s lyric youth amid the
finished certainty and assurance of her later
manner. Her own mature authoritativeness I
can deal with in a fashion and even relish; but in
the winter, in the daily proximity of her husband,
she has an intolerable habit of throwing out flying
buttresses, of quoting Oliver—“Oliver says,”
and so forth—as if she were referring a country
lawyer to a decision of the Supreme Court. It
is a little painful.</p>

<p>Still, in the winter holidays I like to call on the
two of them in their own characteristic setting,
for a variety of reasons which will be obvious
enough to all those provincials who spend the gray
season quietly sitting in silent, snowbound prairie
towns and villages, dreaming, like waifs in a
Scandinavian fairy tale, of the bright commotion
of crowded streets and thronged foyers and Duse
and Pavlowa and grand opera and Conrad and
Lloyd George and Swinnerton and windows full of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
new books and golden gowns and cut flowers.
I remember once remarking to them, after they
had taken me into one of their theatre parties in
the grand style: “Art for the upper classes;
morality for men of moderate incomes; religion
for the poor.” “No”; retorted Oliver, with his
instantaneous eye for the weak spot in my armor:
“Art for the cities; morality for the towns; religion
for the villages.”</p>

<p>We provincials are, it is true, fairly well disciplined
to the stoic “apathy”—a kind of cultivated
hardening of the heart towards everything beyond
the reach of our hands and the range of our eyes.
Through month after month the rosy knuckles of
temptation may knock on our hardened hearts in
vain. But recent investigation proves that under
constant percussion and strain the hardest substances
yield: steel girders buckle, flywheels burst,
and bridges wear out and give way to a malady
known to science as “the fatigue of metals.” An
analogous malady, attacking even the most firmly
tempered of hearts, accounts for the popularity
of Charles Lamb’s “moral holiday,” that excursion
from the moral macadam which nowadays we
call a detour. It explains, too, in my own case,
the sharp nostalgia for the city which afflicts me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>
annually on the depressing morning after Christmas.
On that spiritless day-after, I feel like a
camel that has ruminated on its last cud and can
no longer batten on the desert and the west wind.
I feel like a wretched silkworm in a glass jar, which
will swiftly perish of inanition if not supplied
with fresh mulberry leaves. That explains why
I pack my bag and, by the first Limited train,
creep to the city, under the pretext of reading
a paper before one of the learned associations.</p>

<p>What I am coming to is the rather curious fact
that the attraction of Cornelia’s winter establishment
is perhaps due less directly to her than to
her husband, and to the refreshing and—for me—delightfully
relaxing air of worldliness which
circulates around him. Cornelia wonderfully incarnates
the Eternal Feminine, which is supposed
to draw us upward. But in the interim between
Christmas and the New Year’s Resolutions one
doesn’t desire to be drawn upward. All one
wants is to escape from ennui and suffocation.
In the colloquial idiom of our section, one “wants
out.” And Oliver, in the negligee of old acquaintance,
is a most agreeable, realistic, and sometimes
rather witty Mephistopheles, letting one
out of conventional and cloistral habits of thought,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
and leading one by sharp detours into the heart
of things as they are. Clearly, I don’t dislike
Oliver: I envy him, and, like his other familiars,
call him “Excellency,” a title which I believe few
persons except the Governor of Massachusetts
have any right to use officially. Nor do I think
that Oliver really dislikes me: he pities me, and
calls me “Professor,” a title which he has also
conferred, in my presence, upon the learned Greek
who polishes his shoes. I tell him that both the
Greek and I have a better right to our titles than
he, for Oliver is now writing his reminiscences of
the war, and has at present no official Washington
connection whatever, busy as he seems to be there.</p>

<p>I envy him the variety of his life, the interest
and importance of his personal relations, his
position inside the façade of public affairs, his
understanding of the huge subterranean dynamos
which operate the puppet-show of politics, his
familiarity with the little hairsprings which
govern the dynamos, his chatter of Wall Street
and the Departments and the Legations, and
his inexhaustible stock of unpublished anecdote.
In public he has had the reputation of a strong
team-worker, a sound administrative man; and in
the newspapers he passes as a champion of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>
common people, friend of the farmer and the
laboring man, and the rest.</p>

<p>But twenty-five years of more or less public life
have not stereotyped his mind. In private,
indiscretions bubble from him like water from a
spring. He utters the most profane and contemptuous
condemnation of major enterprises of
his party. In a friendly circle he will even repudiate,
with perfect recklessness, the “asininities”
to which he has been constrained by various public
considerations to subscribe. I twit him on the
essential duplicity of the official character. I call
him what he seems to my academic sense to be—“a
tough little Yankee crab apple, coated with the
wax of European diplomacy”; “a hard-shelled
individualist steeped in Nietzschean philosophy and
merely dipped in democratic shellac.” I insist that
there is no more milk in him than there is in a
billiard ball; and that he values the plain people as
a professional golf-player values his caddies.</p>

<p>In revenge, Oliver blandly replies: “The only
trouble with you professors is that you know
absolutely nothing about life”—a charge which
I always admit; and then pump him for information.
He responds with the—I think—sincere
conviction, shared by many Eastern statesmen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
that we Mid-Westerners are of an unsubjugated
alien race, ominously multiplying within the borders
of the otherwise United States, and mainly
occupied with the propagation of miscellaneous
fanaticisms. He has not yet forgiven me “the
pacifism of the Mississippi Valley when the seaboard
was aflame.” He ascribes to me the
“bolshevism” of North Dakota, and is always
inquiring solicitously: “By the way, how did you
come out with your investments in the Dakota
bonds?” Sometimes he pretends that, as I am
from “Puritan Kansas,” I may have scruples
against breakfasting with them “on the Sabbath”;
if I accept, he turns to Cornelia and gravely warns
her not to forget “the Nebraskan’s grape-juice.”
Or he will ask my permission to light a cigarette,
remarking, “As you are from Utah, I feared it
might be offensive to you.” His mocking compassion
is often excited by my provincial residence
and by my profession. I don’t mind his designating
me as “Pascal,” nor his reference to my correspondence
with Cornelia as <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les lettres provinciales</i>.
But, in one of his sharper moods, I remember his
saluting me as “Calpurnia.” I asked him to enlarge
a little on the idea. “Oh, it’s nothing,” he
replied, “only I hear that nowadays they are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
dismissing all the men from university faculties
and manning them with Cæsar’s wives—with
persons ‘above suspicion.’ I always think of
you professors as Cæsar’s wives.”</p>

<p>Cæsar’s wives? Oliver’s immediate implication,
I suppose, was merely that the public expects on
the part of instructors of youth a quasi-priestly
character, a many-sided and inhuman exemplariness
of opinion and conduct such as neither the
youth in our charge nor their parents require of
themselves. But Oliver meant more than that.
He meant to suggest the absurdity to the realistic
mind—the practical invalidity—of the entire
professional and schoolmasterly point of view,
and the Utopian insubstantiality of our ethical
and social vision. Cæsar’s wives! The sting
of that quip, which he planted in me last
summer, was still rankling a bit on a gray hungry
morning a few days after Christmas, the poison
of it being its truth; and a doubt was stealing
insidiously into my mind, like the snake into the
Garden of Eden, whether perhaps the influence of
the secular priesthood over the democracy might
not be greater if the priesthood abandoned its
attempts to appear so supremely untouched by
the gross human infirmities of the democracy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
when I received a note from Cornelia, and, half
an hour later, a telegram from Oliver. Like all
government officials and even private citizens
who have much breathed the air of official Washington,
Oliver scorns the post office, even for
personal correspondence. For brevity’s sake,
I give the telegram:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I packed my old suit into my old suit-case,
slipped into my inside pocket the old club-paper
which was to pay my expenses, snatched a book
of Gilbert Murray’s to read on the train, and
crept slowly eastward on the Limited. My diary
shows that my occupations during my first forty-eight
hours in the city were about as follows:—</p>

<p>Read my paper, “A Much Higher Education,”
before the Saturday Afternoon Club. Cornelia
was present and I spoke with her for two minutes
afterward. Saw <em>Cyrano</em> Saturday night and
college friends in the stockbroking business for
three hours following. Slept Sunday morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
till cathedral service. Lunched with a poet in
the baking-powder business who read me his free
verse on an affair between a Jewess and a Chinese
laundryman. Spent the afternoon looking at the
pseudo-Rembrandts in the Metropolitan, and the
evening at a concert. Saw journalistic friends
downtown Monday morning. Afternoon; at
rehearsal of a Little Theatre play called “Self-Realization”—lively.
Publishing friend at his
club till six: showed me manuscript of “Petronius
Enamored” and put his collection of suppressed
novels at my disposal. Walked in Riverside Park
till seven, then went to hotel and dressed for
dinner. As I was leaving for the West on the 2.37
in the morning, I packed my bag, and checked
out. Oliver and Willys might want to talk till
daybreak.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="II-4">II<br>
NEW YEAR’S EVE IN NEW YORK</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Mulberry leaves! These details I include in
order to indicate briefly how I reduced the unmannerliness
of my provincial appetite before
I put in my appearance at Oliver’s, and, leaving
my bag at the office, went up one flight to their
apartment. I don’t like to seem too eager.</p>

<p>As I stepped into the clear soft blueness of the
candlelit apartment, Cornelia rose, a silvery
shimmer, from the settee where she had been
chatting with Oliver Junior, and, approaching
with Artemisian stride, greeted me with her
finished graciousness. The artistic perfection of
it might subtly pain a sensitive heart, were it
not for the intimate reassurance imparted by the
rippling overtones of her voice, which resolves
art into intoxication and curiously persuades a
man in evening dress, in the heart of the city,
that he is standing in the midst of a garden full
of flowers. I muse.</p>

<p>Cornelia swiftly explained that Oliver Junior,
though festively attired, would not dine with us.
That spirited and well-groomed youth would, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span>
a few minutes, drive his sister and two of their
friends to a young people’s party in Scarborough.
After I had asked him a few banal questions
about his school, a topic which did not appear
greatly to “intrigue” him, he edged into the adjoining
room and diddled with the piano till his
sister Dorothy skipped in, looking like an adolescent
Bacchante,—she is a little over seventeen,—and
they disappeared together.</p>

<p>Cornelia in the meantime had also explained
that Oliver Senior was in the library with Vernon
Willys. “I don’t like him much,” she added,
“in fact, I think him rather horrid. He is very
happy to-night over his separation from his wife.
He could hardly wait to get inside the door to
tell us about it. But I believe you have discovered
something precious in his books, and Oliver seems
infatuated with him. They have been running
around together all the fall. He is doing a
political novel now, and I accuse Oliver of sitting
for the portrait of the hero. But here they are.”</p>

<p>The two men came in from the library with
red buds in their buttonholes. Oliver as usual
saluted me with a volley of questions, which he
gave me no time to answer, and with an animating
smile, in which I always feel a slightly satirical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
edge. Willys, whom I had met once or twice before,
nipped my arm, smacked his lips, and murmured
with a communicative flicker in his eyes
that I must be sure to see His Excellency’s library
before I left. As we moved toward the dining-room,
Oliver’s quick fire continued: “Did you
get my telegram? Get the point about Bacchus?
I’m feeling the pulse of the country on this prohibition
business. Willys here has convictions,
I find—just as many convictions as you have,
but different. I got you two together in the hope
of hearing you beat each other’s brains out.
I hope you’ll do it in good style. Give him the
Mid-Western gospel. I’ll hold the coats. I’ve
arranged the proper setting. But be human,
Professor! Be human—just for to-night!”</p>

<p>It is not my intention to describe the dinner
in detail. The excellence of a dinner <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à quatre</i>, for
any but a quartet of gourmands, is merely to
provide a soft-footed ministration of successive
felicities to the appetitive nature while the higher
faculties, stimulated by the æsthetic accessories
of the feast, nimbly engage in the discourse of
reason. Of the material details, my memory is
as indistinct as an impressionist poet’s. I recall
only the tall silver of candlesticks on an immaculate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
whiteness which was doubtless linen; and a
soothing greenness which may have been holly;
and a dark rich redness which was certainly roses;
and a fragrance, mingled, various, which was
partly roses and partly, well, I sat at Cornelia’s
right hand, and in that dazzling proximity—she
carries her head so proudly that Time has hardly
ventured to touch a wisp of her bronze-gold hair
or to breathe near her shoulder—in that proximity
I did not notice, honestly did not notice till
some seconds after we were seated, that in front of
each plate was a half-moon formed of three delicate
glasses, glowing with candlelight reflected from
the varicolored souls of old vineyards.</p>

<p>Vernon Willys quite audibly drew in his breath,
which after the visit to His Excellency’s library was
a discreet enough thing to do with it. Oliver, glancing
at me, repeated: “Remember, Professor—be
human.” Then he raised his ruby-colored glass
toward the novelist and said: “Let us drink to
the death of Bacchus.” The two men clinked and
instantly drained their glasses. Cornelia lifted hers
in my direction, just touched it with her lips, and
then replaced it in the semicircle. I was thinking
of Ben Jonson’s old song, that Anacreontic thing
about the thirst that rises from the soul. But what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
I did with my glass, since whatever I did would
grievously offend many persons’ notion of the right
thing to have done, I absolutely refuse to disclose.
That point is of quite subsidiary relevance.</p>

<p>The thing which engaged my attention as a
Mid-Western ethicist and one of “Cæsar’s wives”
was not the content of the glasses nor the number
of times they were filled by the chocolate-colored
Caribbean cupbearer. A person of my long practice
in the ascetic philosophy actually doesn’t
much attend to these matters. I merely—let
us say—became aware of Oliver’s Machiavellian
plot to seduce me. Then what leaped to my sense
as worthy of exploration was just the personal
feeling, the intimate private attitude of my friends,
of precisely this sort of people, toward the ethical
question, or complex group of questions, which
the alleged death of Dionysus and his active
posthumous life have forced into the foreground
of our consciousness. In my own circle at home
no one ever says anything of the faintest interest
on the subject. When it is mentioned, there
may be some talk of law-enforcement; but the
heart of the matter is regarded as perfectly
dead. Here, there was willingness and desire to
discuss the original question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span></p>

<p>His Excellency, I knew, had publicly advocated
the passage of the obnoxious measure, and had
recently given to the press a “strong” statement
on the necessity of enforcing the law. In the
intimacy of friendship, however, and in the circumstances
which he himself had arranged, that
was only a provocation to my remarking, as he
set down his glass:—</p>

<p>“It is obvious that you support the Eighteenth
Amendment with reservations.”</p>

<p>“With a diplomatic reserve,” he corrected,
chuckling. Willys, who had penetrated the
“reserve,” laughed. And Cornelia, crushing a
smile between her lips, entered into a rather
needless explanation, of which the intention, I
perceived, was to dissipate any uneasiness which
a Mid-Western Puritan might be conceived to
feel on his abrupt introduction to a wet New
Year’s Eve.</p>

<p>“Monsieur”—meaning Oliver—“is a little
naughty,” she said, “and he likes to make himself
appear worse than he is. You must remember
that he is practically a European.”</p>

<p>“Oh, nonsense!” I exclaimed. “Oliver a European!
Then so was Andy Jackson.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Cornelia insisted, “his tastes and habits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span>
were formed in the earlier part of his life, when he
was almost constantly abroad. His best friends
in Washington are men in the legations who
aren’t obliged to adopt our reforms. Naturally,
when he entertains them here, he doesn’t wish
to seem inhospitable or absurd, like poor dear
Mr. Bryan. We don’t ordinarily have wine on
the table for our own guests—I mean outside
the semiofficial connection. But just for to-night,
as it’s a holiday, and one of you is a pilgrim from
the Mid-West, Oliver thought—we thought—that
you would appreciate it if ambassadorial
privileges were extended to you.”</p>

<p>“I get the point perfectly,” I said; “that’s
Oliver’s point of view—or one of his points of
view. But please let Janus defend himself. He
will need practice before we Puritans are done
with him. But now that the theme is before us,
Cornelia, won’t you give us the benefit of your
own point of view?”</p>

<p>“My point of view?” Cornelia smiled her
Mona Lisa smile. “I—oh, I am Oliver’s wife!”</p>

<p>“I have often regretted that,” I replied with
a consciously provincial affectation of urban
daring; “but knowing your strict old-fashioned
convictions about marriage, I stifle my regrets.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
I can’t quite reconcile your indulgent humor this
evening with your rigorously prohibitive principles
regarding—well, the moral fluidity of such
novels as Willys writes. I had hoped that your
conservatism, your Puritanism, as they call it,
on the marriage question would bring you around
to our position on prohibition, and so, in that
respect at least, detach you from Oliver.”</p>

<p>“You are dead wrong, Professor,” Willys interjected,
“you are muddled. Prohibition isn’t
conservatism. It is radical innovation. It isn’t
Puritanism. As you yourself have admirably
demonstrated, the Puritans drank like fishes. I
am a Puritan. So is His Excellency. We are
Conservatives. So is our hostess.”</p>

<p>“Your don’t read my articles, Willys,” I said,
“as carefully as I read your novels. What I
demonstrated was, that the Puritan is a radical
innovator. The Puritan of our day says, ‘Let the
dry land appear.’ You are not a Puritan; you
are a Fundamentalist. You wish to return to the
Flood. You are a Diluvian.”</p>

<p>“Now you are at it!” cried Oliver gleefully.
“Go to it!”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” I objected; “we haven’t heard
Cornelia’s point of view yet. I was about to say,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
when Willys broke in, that we educators don’t
attach any great importance to the opinions of
disillusioned politicians and satirical novelists—cynics
like you and Willys. The national culture
is in process of fundamental change and regeneration;
and you belong to an order that will soon
be obsolete, with none to mourn its extinction.
The future of the country is in the hands of the
young people and such of the rest of us as keep up
with them. I am totally indifferent, Cornelia, to
what you think of prohibition as His Excellency’s
wife. In that capacity I doubt if you think at
all; you merely accept the situation. I am curious
only about your attitude as a parent of the new
order, as Oliver Junior’s mother. Won’t you,
for example, psychologize—analyze your feelings
and tell us just why you kissed the glass and set
it down untasted?”</p>

<p>A hint of rose—pride or some deeper emotion—appeared
in Cornelia’s face when I mentioned
her son. He is her religion—the substance of it.
Her husband is the church which she attends from
old habit, repeating her belief in him with her
lips, like the phrases of an ancient creed. But
what she really believes in, with a fervor of
prayer and faith, is her son. I suspected that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span>
Willys and Oliver would think me guilty of bad
taste for bringing into the conversation a subject,
as a Restoration hero remarks of his wife, “so
foreign and yet so domestic.” Somehow children
seem out of place when one is celebrating a moral
holiday! But if one wishes to break down the
guard of a woman who says, “My point of view?
I—oh, I am Oliver’s wife!” one must risk bad
taste. Cornelia’s voice glided softly from gay to
grave as she answered:—</p>

<p>“I kissed the glass for auld lang syne. I set it
down untasted for the sake of the new times and
the children. I used to enjoy it, as I used to
enjoy being twenty years old. It isn’t much to
relinquish, is it?—compared with what one has
to relinquish.”</p>

<p>When Cornelia talks in this vein about age,
she seems to me—well, just ravishingly young;
and I murmured, for our angle of the table only,
“You’ve relinquished nothing!” But she completely
ignored me and continued:—</p>

<p>“As my son’s mother, I am very happy, under
present conditions, to know that he doesn’t
drink or even feel any temptation to drink. We
refrain, my son and I, more as a matter of taste
than as a matter of conscience. Besides, he is too<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
young. In my own home the boys had a glass of
wine on their twenty-first birthday as a part of
the family celebration. And the girls—I can’t
remember that I tasted wine, except in Italy, till
after I was married. Oliver is only nineteen. If,
when he is of age, he is at Oxford, as I hope he
may be, or if he were able at home to have his
wine in a natural atmosphere, simply and innocently,
with gentlemen, I should not wish to deprive
him of what I was brought up to regard as
a proper element of social festivity.”</p>

<p>“Bravo!” cried Willys.</p>

<p>“But, alas,” she concluded, “all that is gone
now. And it’s all so furtive and mean that I
have a horrid feeling. And one hears so many
hateful stories about the secret drinking of mere
boys and girls, at school and at their parties,
treating one another in their cars by the roadside,—and
the consequences of it,—that it’s odious,
just odious. And I—I just sigh a bit for the age
of innocence, and bid it all adieu.”</p>

<p>“Admirable speech!” cried the novelist, as the
Caribbean attendant refilled his glasses. “Beautiful
speech: full of sweet reasonableness—all
but the conclusion. But why adieu? Why turn
down the empty glass? You fill me with lyrical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>
melancholy. ‘Too quick despairer, wherefore
wilt thou go?’ You look too steadily on the small
dark side of the question. There is a soul of goodness
in things evil. Watch and wait! I maintain
that the prohibitionists builded better than they
knew: they have driven drinking out of the barroom
and are bringing it back to the home, where
it belongs, and where as Burke says—doesn’t
he?—it loses all its evil by losing all its grossness,
or something like that. You and His Excellency
are performing a service to posterity by preserving
through this destructive period the purity of
a fine old tradition.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III-4">III<br>
HIS EXCELLENCY ON ECONOMIC NECESSITY</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">I turned to Oliver. “Oliver,” I said, “you
have been shielded by your wife. Now Willys
is apologizing for you. Really, you know, this
won’t do. You will have to come into the open
and speak for yourself. When I go home, my
friends will expect me to give them some intelligent
account of what is going on here beneath the
surface of things. We sit out there among the
cornfields with our radio sets and listen to Washington
uttering austere words about enforcing
the law, and the next morning we read in the
papers that there has been a party under the
shadow of the Capitol, and that there is no one
to see that the law is enforced, because all the
responsible people are busy putting away their
private stocks. Slanderous, no doubt. But in the
ethical sense, how—actually—do you get away
with it? Janus, explain yourself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, very well, Calpurnia,” said Oliver, “yours
to command, remembering only that, as Judge
Black informs me, what a man entrusts to the
wife of his bosom ‘in the sweet confidences of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span>
midnight hour’ she is not permitted to bring into
court against him. But shall I explain myself
as a friend of the government, or as the master
of my private life? As an ornamental pillar of
the administration, or as the captain of my own
soul? Which shall it be?”</p>

<p>“Both, by all means!” Willys exclaimed. “First
one and then the other. First the marble bust
and then the man. First the friend of the aspiring
people and then the friend of the downtrodden
artist. Discuss your public betrayal of your own
class and then your private loyalty to the good
old cause. But tell us first why you passed the
Eighteenth Amendment. I can’t write my next
chapter of <em>Senator Jones</em> till I have an authentic
hunch, the <em>vraie vérité</em>, about the fashion in which
you and the Professor and the Puritans and the
Mid-West and the Anti-Saloon League—in short
the Anglo-Saxon minority—downed the great
hearty Teutonic, Celtic, Italic, Slavic, Hebraic majority,
the glad, gay, sinful, eating-and-drinking
majority, and put it over on us.”</p>

<p>“My dear man,” said His Excellency in his
quietly impressive diplomatic manner, “don’t
tell me that you accept that fable. You call yourself
a realist! Neither the Anti-Saloon League<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
nor the Puritans nor the Professor nor I had
any more to do with passing the Eighteenth
Amendment than a butterfly on a steam-roller
has to do with building the Lincoln highway,
or than a catfish in the Mississippi has to do with
irrigating the rice-fields of Louisiana.”</p>

<p>His Excellency held the point by pausing to
light a cigarette.</p>

<p>“Well, we are waiting,” someone prompted,
after duly respecting his technique.</p>

<p>“<em>Mes enfants</em>,” he continued, and then blew a
ring of white smoke spinning towards the tip of
one of the candles, where it hung for a moment
like a nimbus and then dissolved upward. “My
children, let me disclose to you the fundamental
axiom of political philosophy—not the orthodox
but the esoteric philosophy. Distrust the press
and ignore the palaver of the man in the street.
The press tells you what it thinks will be popular.
The last man in the street tells you what he has
heard said by the next to the last man in the street.
I tell you this: You may scold yourself red in the
face; you may bleed yourself white; you may
shout yourself blue with pietistic, reformatory,
and patriotic fervor; nothing of any importance,
of any public consequence, is ever accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
in this world except by Necessity—by a succession
of linked necessities.”</p>

<p>“The theory isn’t entirely novel, Excellency,”
I said. “And now the application.”</p>

<p>“The necessity which put through the Volstead
Act was the war; the necessity behind that was
the sky-vaulting of wages; the necessity behind
that was maximum production; the necessity behind
that was a workman sober seven days in the
week; the necessity behind that I could make
concrete to you by naming the hundred leading
corporations of the country that were in the belly
of the wooden horse, making his feet track, when
the Anti-Saloon League rode on his back into
Jerusalem—or, if the figure offends you, into
Washington.”</p>

<p>“The figure seems a little mixed at the best,”
said Willys, “but call it Jerusalem—whither
the tribesmen go up to liquidate the burden of
laying taxes on us. As for your chain of necessities,
now that the war is over, that chain is falling
apart. The workingman sees the Big Brother in
the wooden horse, who bullied him into working
six days in the week and into doing, according
to Union standards, two days’ work in one. He
doesn’t like that. Besides, he knows that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span>
Big Brother’s own throat isn’t dry, hasn’t
been dry. The injustice rasps him. He wants
his beer again. He wants the ‘poor man’s club’
again. And he has a jolly good right to have them.
What do you say to that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, he has rights enough,” Oliver assented;
“but the poor man’s club has passed into the
hands of a receiver—a mighty capable one.
The poor man’s club is now in the hands of his
wife. She is in charge now of the Saturday afternoons
and evenings. Do you think, when her
vote is as good as his, she will let him pour his
wages into the sink? Rather not. She has spent
them, spent them in advance, for a generation
to come.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Cornelia. “Isn’t it a pity! Workwomen
are the most wasteful creatures. Why,
when Margaret—”</p>

<p>“You don’t quite get the idea, my dear,”
Oliver resumed. “As I was saying—in war time,
while her old man was sober, with money bulging
his pockets and nowhere to go, she made him buy
her a house and a Ford and a Victrola and savings
stamps and baby bonds. Now she’s buying a
municipal playground along the line of the old
grog-shops and a new schoolhouse and a hospital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</span>
and a couple of movie theatres and a municipal
stadium and a municipal swimming-pool and
God Himself alone knows how many hundred
thousand miles of the finest and most expensive
roads in the world.”</p>

<p>“Why, Oliver dear,” cried Cornelia, “what
do you mean?” I don’t know anything more
painful than to report the occasional fatuity of
a woman whom one almost unreservedly admires.
But dear Cornelia has not meditated very deeply
on the problems of the working classes. And
returning to her point, she insisted: “I’m sure
Margaret hasn’t bought any swimming pools or
hospitals.”</p>

<p>“No, my dear,” said Oliver calmly, “I doubt
if she has. But as I was saying, she has her own
ideas of a club—that woman. She is a Progressive.
As a big employer in Pittsburgh said to me
yesterday, ‘She has tasted blood.’ She has dug
in, and is going to extend her works. Wages won’t
go down; they’ll be higher to-morrow morning.
Why? Do you suppose that new outfit of hers is
paid for? Rather not. Do you suppose that the
business men are going to continue in business
and collect their bills? Do you suppose they know
what kind of plain people pay their bills and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span>
have money to spend? I fancy they do. Well!
The Big Brother is still in the wooden horse.
Maximum production and high wages till the
Judgment Day. And Prohibition! The only
ticket on which any party will hold office. That’s
my forecast—as a servant of the government
and a friend of the workingman.”</p>

<p>“Heaven help the poor workingman,” cried
Willys, “and spare us a few noble specimens of
the idle rich. But now, Excellency, you must
cheer our fainting spirits by explaining your
point of view as the master of your private life.”</p>

<p>“As the master of my private life,” said Oliver
promptly, “I deny that I am any such Janus as
the Professor here tries to make me out. As a
private citizen, I still believe that prohibition
cannot be repealed. Within this belief I merely
include, as a private citizen, my philosophic
certainty that it will never be enforced, except
where it is economically necessary. In my case
it is not necessary; therefore, it will not be enforced.
Its enforcement helps the business of
the plain people; it would hinder mine. It adds, on
the whole, very greatly to the comfort of their
lives. It would detract from mine. The whole
case against liquor grew out of the plain people’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
abuse of it. The whole case of liquor will be improved
by my right use of it. There is no ‘rasping
injustice,’ but a beautiful poetic justice in their
losing theirs and in my keeping mine. That
doesn’t express adequately my generosity in
lending my hand to riveting the workingman’s
benefits firmly upon him. Many of the most
decorative and not the least substantial pillars
of prohibition are men of excellent and experienced
palate. The most sincere and the most
competent advocates of the cause are the nonconforming
prohibitionists. I simply cannot
understand the Senator who refers to the Volstead
Act as an idiotic measure and a failure. It was
absolutely necessary: nothing which is necessary
is idiotic. And every economist will tell you that
it has been a marvelous economic success. It
wonderfully accomplishes what had to be done,
and it leaves undone what it ought not to do.
And there you are.”</p>

<p>“And there <em>you</em> are!” retorted Willys, “you and
your economic argument. But where are the rest
of us? I’m sorry to say that, for economic reasons,
I can’t follow you. My bootlegger is devouring
my royalties. Therefore, as you would say, I have
strong conscientious objections to illicit liquor.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>“I had rather overlooked that possibility,”
said Oliver. “But lean on me—at least till
you have finished <em>Senator Jones</em>.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Willys, “I’ll do so. But
seriously speaking—”</p>

<p>“Forgive me!” Cornelia interposed, with a delightful
wave of her hand flagging the onrush of
the novelist’s volubility. “Before Mr. Willys
begins to speak seriously, suppose we adjourn
to the library. You remember that Oliver is likely
to lose his temper if I keep him too long at the
table fiddling with cigarettes.”</p>

VERNON WILLYS ON BACCHIC ECSTASY</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">I have never had leisure to examine the books
in the library which range from floor to ceiling.
Sargent’s portrait of Cornelia at twenty-five hangs
above the fireplace. When we had relaxed in
Oliver’s wonderful library chairs before a real
log fire, and had been equipped with an ambassadorial
type of cigar, which the elder Carib
lighted for us, and had been fortified by the
highest potency of a private stock of real Java
coffee, we men, at least, were in a position to
contemplate the approaching midnight with equanimity.
As soon as this change of base had been
fully effected, Cornelia, who seldom loses the
connection of things, irradiated the novelist
with her most hospitable smile. (I sometimes
think my feeling for her is pure intellectual
respect for her skill in keeping a good topic
alive and not letting conversation die out in
small talk.) She smiled and said:—</p>

<p>“Mr. Willys, you were just about to speak seriously,
when I interrupted. Please speak seriously,
Mr. Willys. We are all most anxious to have you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, my point of view, you mean?” said
Willys. I admired his ability to find it again so
quickly. “Speaking seriously, I can’t—for more
or less obvious reasons—take as calmly as His
Excellency does the poor man’s loss of pleasures.
I appeal from the tyranny of our recent moral
legislation to my constitutional guaranties of
liberty and the right to pursue my happiness
where I can find it. I agree with the Senator that
the whole business is idiotic. It is idiotic impertinence
to dictate what I shall eat and drink at my
own table, or what I shall brew in my own cellar.”</p>

<p>“If you had a cellar?” suggested Cornelia,
rather spitefully reminding us of Willys’s arrangements
to leave his house in New Jersey to his wife,
and his wife to his house. But, as I have said, she
is firm on such points.</p>

<p>“Spare the wormwood, Cornelia darling,” Oliver
blandly interceded. “But, Willys, if you have a
better remedy for our present discontents than
mine, don’t conceal it from the country. Everyone
is clamoring for it. Only be sure it is a remedy.
Be sure it rests firmly on the necessities of the
situation. There is no use in talking of anything
else.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you my remedy,” said Willys, “when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
I get done telling you my troubles. I object to
governmental regulation of my diet. But I object
even more to governmental corruption of my conscience.
God knows I need what little I’ve got
left, and I’d like to keep it pure. I protest against
the creation of crime by Act of Congress. My conscience
tells me that moderate drinking is not a
crime, but one of the few certain solaces in this
chaotic world.”</p>

<p>“I had always fancied,” said Cornelia, “that
those who find drink a ‘certain solace’ are seldom
very moderate.”</p>

<p>But the cork, so to speak, was out of Willys’s
bottle. He flowed on unchecked.</p>

<p>“I protest against the legislative destruction of
old customs which every civilized nation under
heaven but ours respects. Your Excellency has
seen the vintage in Greece, Italy, France, Germany—Persia,
too, haven’t you, not to speak of
our Gulf Islands? Consider merely the picturesqueness
of it! The romance of it! Blood of the
grape! Bottled sunshine! We had a bit of it ourselves,
here and there—in the green vineyards of
northern California, wild grapes on the Sangamon,
moonshine in the Kentucky mountains, mint-julep
on the old Southern plantations. Even the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
cocktail, you know, our own national contribution,
had begun to be humanized and to have its tender
local associations, as every club of distinction
modified its ingredients and christened it with
some lovely name: The Chrysanthemum, The
Chrysostom, The Golden Girl, and so forth.
Doesn’t it really stir your imagination a little?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Oliver, first smacking his lips
and then pursing them with mock severity. “Yes,
we grant you all that. But what is the necessity
of it? We are talking of necessities, not of sentiments.
We, we Midlanders—the Professor and
myself—want to know what necessity requires
the tolerance of a mere beverage which is so liable
to become a beastly nuisance.”</p>

<p>“Exactly so,” I said.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you the necessity,” replied Willys.
“And I’ll tell you, too, that it goes far deeper than
your economic theory. I return to the Saturday
nights of the workingman. You know, I know,
everyone with two grains of sense knows, that
there is something desirous in the inside of a man
which even hard roads and baby bonds don’t
satisfy. That something is a primitive and profound
need of our elemental nature for excitement
and every now and then for something like intoxication.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</span>
Why, my wife says,—excuse me, a lady
with whom I was formerly acquainted used to
say,—‘No woman can get along on less than a
thrill a day,’ of one sort or another. It’s rooted in
the human organism—this hunger for occasional
escape from humdrum. ‘Tedium’—what was it
you said the other day, Professor? Rather good,
you know—‘tedium is three fourths of life.’ I
agree with you there, Professor; only I figure the
tedious fraction is larger than that, even for
moderately contented and comfortable people.
And for the multitude, for the masses, the fraction
that is not tedium is almost negligible, when it is
not positive pain. But—<em>but</em>, in that microscopic
fraction there must be a few moments or hours
of heightened consciousness, a burst of hilarity, a
breath of freedom, a little dream, a little edge of
ecstasy—or a man will cut his throat in order
to feel that he is alive.”</p>

<p>“It is not done among the sort of people we
associate with,” said Cornelia, whom the argument
impressed as rather silly.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not,” said Willys, “perhaps not.
Perhaps you ‘escape’ in some other fashion. But I
say His Excellency is wrong in making light of the
poor man’s club. It’s his safety valve. Take the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
poor devil to whom Saturday night has been the
only bright spot in a black week. Deny him beer,
he drinks whiskey; deny him whiskey, he drinks
vanilla extract; if he can’t get vanilla extract,
he takes to methyl alcohol; or he falls back
on drugs, and takes to theft and burglary, and
crimes of violence.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you leaning rather heavily, Willys,” I
said, “on what you allege prohibition has done to
the criminal classes? You can’t expect repeal of
prohibition in behalf of thieves and thugs.”</p>

<p>“As for the upper classes,” said Willys, “I won’t
offend our hostess by knowing anything that
simply ‘isn’t done.’ But just consider what every
one knows: the Capuan character of the New York
roof-garden; the Corinthian style of current dancing;
nice young girls at petting-parties indistinguishable,
actually indistinguishable in costume
and paint and manner from courtesans; the
high spots that can’t be kept out of movies; the
chief interest in the novels we’re reading and
writing; and then the general domestic smash-up
that is following prohibition. There are
worse things than a liquor license, Professor,
and we’ve got the whole pack of them on our
backs by putting in prohibition.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span></p>

<p>I quoted my favorite passage from King Lear:
“We make guilty of our disasters the sun, the
moon, and the stars, as if we were villains of
necessity, fools by heavenly compulsion, drunkards,
liars, and adulterers by an enforced obedience
of planetary influence, and all that we are evil in,
by a divine thrusting on.”</p>

<p>“Quite pat, Professor,” exclaimed Willys, whose
wits are quick enough. “And there is, by George,
a divinity in it. I maintain it’s the vengeance of
Dionysus! We’ve tried to bind a god, and, by
George, he’s getting back at us. See what I mean?
Have you read Euripides, Excellency?”</p>

<p>“Once on a time,” Oliver said, “not lately. Tell
us about it.”</p>

<p>“A great work—his <em>Bacchae</em>. Everybody ought
to read it. You see, there’s a reformer in Athens,
called Pentheus, a straitlaced, stiff-necked Puritan,
an out-and-out prohibitionist, a—a regular Mid-Western
professor. Well, the young god—Dionysus,
you know—comes over into Greece from
Asia with his choruses, singing and dancing and
swinging the ivy-wreathed thyrsus—and all that
beautiful joyous stuff, you know. But this Pentheus
makes up his mind that Dionysus is a bad
lot, and he locks the god up in the stable—passes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
a sort of Volstead Act on him, you understand.
But he gets out—the god gets out. Of course, he
gets out; on the q.t. He escapes into the hills—classical
moonshine, classical bootlegging, you see.
The women get hold of the stuff and, up there in the
hills, begin celebrating ‘mysteries’—all on the
q.t. Attorney-General Pentheus says this must be
stopped—law must be enforced. He sleuths up
into the hills to spy them out. But the women, his
own mother among them, catch him, and literally
pull him to pieces, tear him limb from limb and
strew the bloody fragments all over the place.
That’s the vengeance of Dionysus.”</p>

<p>“How perfectly horrid!” exclaimed Cornelia.</p>

<p>“You know the play, Professor,” said Willys,
of course.</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” I replied, as if I had been intimate
with it from infancy. As a matter of fact, Oliver’s
telegraphic reference to Bacchus had prompted
me to chuck Gilbert Murray’s little book on
Euripides into my traveling bag for train reading.
That accident enabled me to sustain my bluff by
a bit of critical wisdom. “The play is curious,”
I said, “coming from Euripides. He passes for
a progressive, an intellectual radical. You would
have expected him to sympathize with Pentheus,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
of course. But I notice that Gilbert Murray
doesn’t accept the old theory that Euripides
recanted and went back to the ancestral gods.”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied Willys, “in that case, I think
Gilbert Murray is wrong—who is this Gilbert
Murray? I’ve got the play here—in my overcoat
pocket—somebody or other’s translation,
of course. You take it with you, Professor, when
you go. Read it again and tell me if you don’t
think I’m right.”</p>

<p>I had to laugh; and then we both explained how
we happened to be reading, or reading about, the
<em>Bacchae</em>. Then Willys returned to his argument.</p>

<p>“When I read this play, you know, it hit me in
the eye that this thing is as old as history. This
prohibition idiocy is as old as the race. If drinking
could be rooted out, it would have been rooted
out long ago. All the arguments against it were
cheesy in the days of Noah. It sticks because, as
His Excellency and I are pointing out, it is rooted
in necessity. You reformers, as you call yourselves,
don’t know what you are about. You’ve
bit off what can’t be chewed. You are attacking
religion; and it’s dangerous business. You are
trying to kill a god, and it can’t be done.”</p>

<p>“But my dear Mr. Willys,” cried Cornelia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
“it isn’t <em>our</em> God. The Church hasn’t really
defined its position, and of course some of the
bishops are very liberal. But don’t the dissenters
in this country take a very firm stand in favor of
prohibition? Most Americans are dissenters, aren’t
they? If so, then I should think you would call
prohibition itself a religious movement.”</p>

<p>“It has long been identified with the popular
evangelical churches,” I said.</p>

<p>“Don’t talk to me about the evangelical
churches,” cried Willys. “The ‘uplift’ has hit the
churches till they are nothing but community-improvement
societies, with no more religion in
them than the municipal waterworks. There is
no more real relation between religion and prohibition
than there is between signing the pledge
and seeing the Beatific Vision. Wine is as much
a part of our traditional religion as it was of the
Greek religion. The Jews still drink their Passover
wine. Why shouldn’t they? What do you
make of that passage in the Old Testament about
the winecup in the hand of God? What do you
make of the wine at the marriage feast in the New
Testament? Or the wine in the Holy Grail? Or
the sacramental wine, drunk by all the faithful,
till the spirit of mystical fellowship evaporated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
in the grape-juice of that paradox, the individual
communion cup?”</p>

<p>“But it’s much more sanitary that way,” said
Cornelia firmly, “really much nicer. And since
everyone knows that it’s only a beautiful old
form—”</p>

<p>“Oh, you formalists!” Willys ejaculated. “You
formalists are the real atheists. Till the days of
frank atheism, we wished our friends Godspeed,
we pledged their healths, and we launched our
ships with a libation of wine. The central act of
religious worship for two thousand years was a
kind of sacred intoxication in the blood of the
living God. Omit the central act, and religion
disappears; and all you’ve got left is a lot of
unedifying bishops wrangling over ‘the higher
criticism’ of fifty years ago. It’s the vengeance
of the Dionysiac element in Christianity overtaking
them. I repeat what I said before—It’s
just as true of bishops as it is of workingmen:
human life can’t be sustained without a little edge
of ecstasy. If we try it, something will burst.
That’s my forecast!”</p>

<p>“And your remedial measure—” said Oliver,
“your remedy, rooted in the necessities of the
situation?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>“Why, moderate drinking, of course,” replied
the novelist, lapsing into the wide arms of the
chair, like one from whom all the virtue has departed.
“Teach Americans to drink as the Greeks
drink to-day: wine everywhere, no one drunk.”</p>

<p>“Not a bad idea,” chuckled His Excellency.</p>

<p>“An idea of quite startling originality,” I added.</p>

<p>“Our ‘dry battery’ is crackling with suppressed
thunderbolts,” said Oliver. “But”—he
glanced at his watch—“it lacks only ten minutes
of midnight and the dawn of a better era for the
world. While the inhabitants of this borough of
Manhattan are meditating on their sins of the
past year, and signifying repentance by various
acts of atonement, it is fitting that we should
not let the hour pass without some appropriate
ceremony. Professor, you haven’t seen my new
set of Casanova—a Christmas gift from the
wittiest of my French friends. Let me show it
to you. Willys admires it immensely.”</p>

<p>Willys and I followed our host to his bookshelves,
while Cornelia idly turned the pages of
the new <em>American Mercury</em>. But why go into details?
Oliver’s edition of the <em>Mémoires</em>, handsomely
bound in full morocco and locked in a
glass case, proved to be the mask of His Excellency’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
“diplomatic reserve.” From the ingredients
of two or three “volumes” he compounded something
which he told us was known in Washington
as the “Gentlemen’s Agreement,” because it
agreed with gentlemen.</p>

<p>As the clock and the bells and the whistles
sounded the knell of 1923, Oliver exclaimed,
“Why, Cornelia, where’s the Professor’s buttermilk,”
and he and Willys clinked glasses, and
drank “To the vengeance of Dionysus!”</p>

I EXPLAIN THE POSITION OF CÆSAR’S
WIVES</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">“And now,” said His Excellency, stroking his
silvered brown beard and turning upon me the
raillery of his dynamic dark eyes, “it’s up to you,
Professor. You’ve been sitting here like one of
Uncle Sam’s ‘observers’ at a peace conference—a
chiel a-takin’ notes, an’ sayin’ nuthin’. Don’t
you know that henceforth there shall be no more
neutrals? You are our only representative of the
great drouthy forward-looking West. Don’t you
know that the business of a representative is to
represent? The wife of my bosom is on the fence—a
friendly noncombatant, as is proper to her
sex. But Willys and I have got you backed into
a corner. I’ve shown the economic necessity
of prohibition. Willys has shown the religious
necessity of drink. What is the Mid-West going
to do about it? Which way are you going to
break? Break, Professor! But stick, as we have
done, to the necessities of the case.”</p>

<p>“I am as much a necessitarian as you are,
Excellency,” I said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</span></p>

<p>“You’d better be,” chuckled Oliver. “Cæsar’s
wives, I suspect, had better be necessitarians.”</p>

<p>“But I am as religious as Willys,” I added.</p>

<p>“That’s very right,” said Willys.</p>

<p>“And so,” I continued, “I shall take a middle
ground.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Oliver, “the golden mean, or
temperance. Too little temperance is chronic
inebriety. Too much temperance is teetotalism.
Prohibition may and must be defended as the
only known means to insure moderate drinking
among the better sort of people. Exactly my
position!”</p>

<p>“No, Excellency,” I said, “you don’t see.
Mine is not exactly your position. I take the
middle position according to a precept of Pascal:
I seize upon both extremes and occupy all the
ground between. But my extremes are not yours.
The extremes which I have in mind are your
economic necessitarianism and Willys’s religion—his
theory of the necessity of religious excitement.
I lay hold of both those positions as firmly as
you and Willys; but I reconcile them, instead
of making them mutually destructive. Starting
from the same premises, I reach a different
conclusion.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</span></p>

<p>“Of course,” said Oliver, “of course. But
what is it?”</p>

<p>“Before I state it,” I said, “may I, since I am
on the defensive, take a minute to rebut your
fallacies and to present, as you and Willys have
done, my more intimate personal feeling and
private point of view?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” murmured Willys, rather sleepily,
“that will be very proper.”</p>

<p>“It will be good for you, Willys,” I said. “I
shall not hurt you more than is necessary. And
I shall not be half so tedious as I might be if I
were not leaving town on the 2.37. Relief is in
sight; my taxi will be here at one.”</p>

<p>“At one?” said Cornelia. “The children
promised to be home by one, or earlier. Oliver,
couldn’t you all—”</p>

<p>“Why certainly,” Oliver said. “Send away
your taxi, Professor. When the Infant comes in
with the car, we’ll drive you to the station, and
then I’ll take Willys to his hostelry. But go
ahead now, Professor, with your personal narrative
of the great drouth in the Mojave Desert.”</p>

<p>“It’s the first forty years without water that’s
hardest,” I said. “After that, one gets on nicely.
Do you know that, far from being keen for this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
argument, the entire subject bored me terribly,
till you and Willys drenched it again in—in
reality. Since my student days a generation ago,
I have hardly even seen liquor enough of all
sorts to float an old-fashioned alumni reunion
for a single evening. A resident during the latter
half of my life in a bone-dry district, I, like most
of my neighbors, view the annual extension of
the dry lands with the aloofest academic interest.”</p>

<p>“Of course!” said Oliver, smiling, “of course!
But you can abridge that; we all know the quality
of a professor’s interest in any matter of first-rate
importance.”</p>

<p>“It was not till bootleggers were commonly
reported to be as ubiquitous as German spies in
wartime,” I resumed, “and men began to attribute
all the evils of the hour to prohibition, and seriously
to argue that the Volstead Act was forcing
drunkenness and criminality upon numberless respectable
citizens who thitherto had led lives of
unblemished virtue—it was not till then that I
began to feel a certain curiosity about the facts,
and especially about the mental condition of
intelligent and responsible people resident in
territory which is still subterraneously wet.”</p>

<p>“Their mental condition, Professor?” Oliver<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span>
inquired. “Why, pray, their mental condition?”</p>

<p>“Because I couldn’t understand, Excellency,” I
replied, “how intelligent men like you and Willys,
who have lived abroad, could permit yourselves to
attribute the sexually hectic flush of recent literature
and life in America to the Volstead Act.
All these evils, says Willys, followed prohibition,
and he wags his head and mutters, ‘Vengeance
of Dionysus.’ Suppose, now, I seize the same
absurd <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post-hoc-propter-hoc</i> principles and attribute
the virginal chastity of French, Italian,
and English fiction and private life to the free
use of intoxicating beverages?”</p>

<p>“I smell irony, Professor, somewhere,” said
Oliver, “but I grant you that Willys’s logic
slipped a cog there. We’ll have to grant you
that America dry is no more sex-obsessed than
Europe wet.”</p>

<p>“And then,” I went on, “I was a little troubled
by Willys’s plea that, with the general decline of
drinking in America, something of real poetic
beauty is passing out of our lives. I honestly can’t
feel that he speaks realistically about that. I know
the Anacreontic tradition, the literary romance of
nut-brown ale and blood-red wine, perhaps as well
as Willys does, and in the bookish imagination of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>
youth used myself to revel with those that ‘gloried
and drank deep.’ Used to spout, you know, about
‘Bairam, that great hunter,’ and the ‘sons of Ben’
at the Mermaid, and so on. But when I had an
opportunity to compare the Bacchic frenzy of an
ancient Greek or Persian or Elizabethan, as represented
by the poets, with the Bacchic frenzy of an
American citizen howling drunk—I declare, it
was one of the major disillusions of my life. The
actual beauty of the real thing has come at last to
impress me as very nebulous, like the amours of
Thomas the Rhymer with the queen of the fairies.
The lover is too often left ‘alone and palely loitering,’
with a crumpled shirt-front, with his hat in
the gutter, by a green lamp-post—‘where no
birds sing.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, green grapes!” stuttered Willys. “What
can you make of green grapes! What can you know
about it, Professor? On your own showing it’s
twenty years since—”</p>

<p>“True, Willys,” I replied, “true. But the pathos
of distance ought to lend a glamour to one’s
memories. One has, you know, one’s memories.
Even a Mid-Western professor has his memories;
and in the deep interval of twenty years all that is
ugly in them should have faded out, should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
been gathered into the blue mist of oblivion, leaving
the soft contours of the Bacchic landscape
bathed in pure beauty. I don’t find it so. I see—”</p>

<p>I hesitated. In a company like this, it is a bit
awkward to talk on the killjoy side of a question.
But Oliver rallied me forward.</p>

<p>“Tell us what you see. Professor,” he said.
“Life or death, give us only reality. Show us the
sad pictures in the prohibitionist gallery of
disillusion. We’ll try to look interested.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “Willys’s praise of this beautiful
old custom of getting drunk now and then did
press a button in my gallery of memories and light
up a few old pictures. They are relevant only because
I did have, in my earlier years, about the
average American’s chance to feel the æsthetic
value of this vanishing phase of our popular
culture. I see pictures. As Whitman says, ‘The
shapes arise.’”</p>

<p>“Whitman was a priest of Dionysus,” said
Willys.</p>

<p>“So was Emerson,” I said, “and so, according to
my lights, am I. The shapes arise. I see a strayed
reveler, with no vine leaves in his hair,—only a
shirt, trousers, and suspenders,—lying on his
back, and shouting children towing him by a rope<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
attached to his foot, through the main streets of an
Arizona town; the reveler grins and plucks feebly
at the rope and says, ‘Now, boys!’ This picture is
thirty years old. I see a driveling swaying figure in
a crowd at a street corner in Los Angeles, trying to
give away the contents of his pocketbook. I see a
Vermont farmer in his haymow, surly and maudlin
with the unfreezable alcoholic element of frozen
apple-cider; he jabs his cow with the tines of his
hayfork. Returning from a mountain camp at midnight
to a Massachusetts village, I see in the road
before me a dim mass reeling through the moonlight
and entering a cottage in the outskirts, and
two minutes later I hear a woman’s voice shrieking,
‘Murder! murder! murder!’”</p>

<p>“Yes,” yawned His Excellency, “I have always
insisted that the peasantry and the proletariat
were nasty in their liquor—serves them right to
lose it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t interrupt my vision,” I said. “The
shapes arise. I see in a New England city a trolley
car full of sick college students scrambling for the
rear platform—one of them lies at full length in
the passage; he is a little trampled. I see a fellow
student regularly soaking his shredded-wheat biscuit
in whiskey; he carries his flask to morning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
chapel. I see another, stepping—without vine
leaves—into the open shaft of an elevator; no god
bears him up. I see other youths of the better sort
in large numbers in a smoke-heavy place of midnight
refreshment, after a football victory, treating
to hot whiskey weary-looking painted girls in
black—Stephen Phillips’s ‘disillusioned women
sipping fire.’ I see five professional men on a
moral holiday, seriously approaching the task of
consuming three quarts of Scotch and Bourbon before
morning. I see groggy alumni embracing one
another in tears, hugely pleased to be drunk with
men to whom they never speak when they are
sober. I see derelict artists and novelists and
lawyers, quietly slipping away from professional
life to settle down in a rustic hermitage to drink
themselves to death. I see a group of permanent
class-secretaries in secret session, running through
the long list of alumni in every college who never
report and never turn up; the secretaries know
why, but they publish no report.”</p>

<p>“Good heavens, Professor,” groaned Willys,
“His Excellency and I were not born yesterday,
and doubtless even our hostess knows there
are some casualties. Whiskey isn’t buttermilk.
Knives have edges, and are dangerous. Everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</span>
that’s good for anything is dangerous. But
really now, what is the point of all this?”</p>

<p>“It has a point,” I replied; “it has a point at
both ends. It bristles with points; and all of them
are dangerous to you and your remedy for our discontents—your
moderate drinking. The first
point is this: that customary drinking in America,
whatever it may be in Greece, has been and is, on
the whole, not beautiful but ugly, disgusting, and
destructive. The second point is this: that customary
drinking in America is so inveterately intemperate
that your proposal to institute a custom
of temperate drinking is really far more visionary
and impractical than prohibition. Your remedy is
not conceived with an eye to the essential facts in
the case.”</p>

<p>“And these are—” prompted His Excellency.</p>

<p>“These are,” I said, “that Americans of both
upper and lower classes are temperamentally hard
to stop when they are started. Ninety out of every
hundred Americans feel a curious pride in ‘seeing
the whole show’; in ‘going the whole hog’;
in ‘sticking the thing out’; in ‘going the limit’;
in ‘getting results’; and in ‘getting there first.’
This temperament shows in their drinking as in
everything else. They care nothing for taste or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span>
‘bouquet.’ They value their liquor in proportion to
the quickness of the ‘kick.’ ‘I can let the stuff
alone,’ they say, ‘but when it speaks to me, I
want it to speak with some authority.’”</p>

<p>“The first really sensible thing you’ve said this
evening,” said the novelist.</p>

<p>I was tempted to mention his perfectly callous
consumption of Oliver’s choice Spanish wine as a
case in point; but I restrained myself and said:—</p>

<p>“A Frenchman sits down at a table on the
boulevard with a single small glass of light wine;
and sips, and rolls it under his tongue; and sips,
and studies a cloud in the sky; and sips, and holds
the glass up to the light; and sips, and looks at
the river, and quotes a couple of verses of Ronsard;
and sips, and considers what he was doing in April
a year ago; and lifts the glass, and puts it down,
and counts his change; and so on for half an hour
or an hour; while the Yankee traveler at the
next table selects a bottle of the most expensive
wine on the list, gulps it down like ice-water,
and sighs for a good American cocktail. We were
born whiskey-drinkers, high and low, men and
women.”</p>

<p>“I adore wine, but I abominate the taste of
whiskey,” said Cornelia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span></p>

<p>His Excellency relieved me of the obvious duty
of saying that her taste in that, as in all things,
is exceptional.</p>

<p>“The Professor,” he continued, “overdraws it
a little; but there is much in what he says.
Historically considered, we have, as a people,
rather taken to extremes: George III or pure
democracy; abolition or a thousand niggers; the
book of Genesis or Robert Ingersoll; for better,
for worse till death do us part, or Brigham Young
and his twenty-eight wives; the town wide-open
or the town bone-dry; milk-shake or whiskey
neat. It hangs together. You’ll have to admit,
Willys, that moderate as you and I are, as a
people we insist on going in for a kick. It’s
rooted in what you yourself called the primitive
and profound necessities of our national temper.”</p>

<p>“It’s rooted,” said Willys, “in the artificial
necessities created by our national puritanism.
It’s rooted in the artificial necessity of being
ashamed to drink at home, and having to live,
like a false little Sunday-School god, in the eyes
of a sanctified wife and puritanized children.”</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Willys!” Cornelia exclaimed.</p>

<p>“It’s the truth,” insisted the novelist. “It
is rooted in the necessity thrust upon a poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span>
devil by the surrender of public opinion to the
prohibition bullies—the necessity of carrying
a portable kick in his hip pocket, or, in the old
days, of standing up with his foot on the rail
and taking it quick and getting out before his
neighbor—came in for his.”</p>

<p>“No, cynic,” I said, “it is rooted in a deeper
necessity than that—and a real one, which can’t
be essentially changed. I mean, that our national
custom of whiskey-drinking was rooted, like all
bad things,—according to His Excellency,—in
the Mid-West, rooted through a thousand
miles of the richest corn-land in the world. Do
you know that if the Atlantic Ocean were pumped
dry and we Mid-Westerners applied our resources
to it, we could fill the basin with corn whiskey
every year? That is the real reason why a kick-loving
people would, in America, always be a
whiskey-drinking people. And that is one of the
reasons why we Mid-Westerners have maturely
decided to feed our corn to hogs.”</p>

<p>“A-ha!” cried Oliver. “Striking into your
argument at last! Economic theory of morals!
My argument! I ‘get’ you, as you Midlanders
say.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Excellency,” I assented, “you get me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
very well. As a ‘friend of the plain people,’
you get me very well. I accept the whole of your
economic argument for the necessity of prohibition.
I accept every word that you say on the expensiveness
of the reconstructed workman’s club, on the
expensiveness of his wife’s post-bellum tastes,
of the long future in which we may expect high
wages, of the continued necessity for maximum
production. But you hardly scratched the surface
of the argument. You have hardly glimpsed
the expanding expensiveness which the average
life in America is soon going to exhibit. We are
headed straight and hard for an era of broad,
inclusive, expensive popular culture. The plain
people, whom we’ve been feeding for a hundred
years on the skim-milk and fragments of old
morality and religion, are developing an appetite
for comfort, for health, for knowledge, for
recreation, for variegated pleasure, for style, for
art, and for beauty, which is the most expensive
thing in the world. Prohibition—and the average
man knows this, even the moderately intelligent
workman knows this—prohibition has
its tap root of necessity in the imperative choice
of our entire society between ‘booze’ on the one
hand, and, on the other, beauty, art, style,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</span>
pleasure, knowledge, health, and comfort—which
he knows, and you know, are the real
tangible substance of modern upper-class religion.”</p>

<p>“Oho!” cried Willys. “Getting around to my
argument at last. But it doesn’t sound much
like what I mean by religion.”</p>

<p>“Religion!” cried Cornelia. “Why, it isn’t
religion at all!”</p>

<p>“What is religion, my dear Cornelia?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Why, religion,” she replied, “is what the
bishops agree are the fundamental teachings of
the Church.”</p>

<p>“It is not!” I retorted, with the intimate
discourtesy and dogmatism of an old friend who
is also an old puritan. “My dear Cornelia,” I
hastened to add, “that is theology—not religion.”</p>

<p>“Tell Cornelia,” said Oliver,—whom the high
Anglican tendencies of his wife rather amuse,—“tell
Cornelia, Professor, what religion is.”</p>

<p>“Your religion,” I responded, “is what you
actually believe in, whatever that is. My religion
is what I actually believe in, whatever it is. The
religion of the average American is what he
actually believes in, whatever it is. What do
you actually believe in, Cornelia?”</p>

<p>“I believe,” she replied firmly, “in the Apostolic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</span>
Church, in the communion of saints—”</p>

<p>“His Excellency, for example, among them?”
suggested Willys, saucily enough.</p>

<p>“Really, Mr. Willys!” said Cornelia. I felt
the air cold on my cheek. I doubt if it lowered
the temperature of Willys. He merely said, “I
am a realist,” and lapsed again.</p>

<p>Cornelia repeated, “I believe in the Apostolic
Church—,” and this time I interrupted.</p>

<p>“The average American,” I said, “does not—at
least, he does not believe in it with any such
fullness of faith as he accords to baseball.”</p>

<p>“The tone of this conversation is becoming
decidedly distasteful to me,” said Cornelia. She
picked up a copy of <em>Vogue</em> and buried herself
in it, pretending to lose all her interest in our
discussion.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” I said, “but I too, like Willys,
am a realist. I have learned much from the master
realists of my time—I mean the salesmen. I
have learned, when I wish to make a religious
appeal to man, to appeal to him on the basis of
the things in which he really believes. If a man’s
real belief is small and mean, you’ve got to begin
mean and small. If he believes only in his pocketbook,
I must appeal to his pocketbook. If he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</span>
believes in his children, I can appeal to him
through his children.”</p>

<p>“Excuse me,” said Cornelia, rising, “it’s
nearly time for the children to come home. I
will telephone down to the office to have them
send away your taxi.” When she returned from
giving the message at Oliver’s desk-telephone,
she picked up her <em>Vogue</em> again, and seated herself
outside our circle, near the tall windows
looking on the street. We readjusted our positions
by the fire so that our backs should not be turned
to her, and I continued:—</p>

<p>“The real business of religion is to reconcile us
to our necessities. According to the powerful drive
of Oliver’s economic argument, the outstanding
necessity to which the average American has now
got to be reconciled, is prohibition. That is a
rather hard selling-proposition. I don’t think it
can be put over except under pressure of some sustained
religious emotion, or as Willys calls it,
‘excitement.’ Now don’t you see how important it
is to know what the average American sustains a
religious emotion about—what he really does
believe in?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s all right,” said His Excellency.
“What next?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</span></p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “if the average American registers
no emotion about the Apostolic Church, we
can’t use that in a case like this, can we? We’ve
got to fall back on our really common bonds of
union—like our common belief in modern plumbing,
health, youth, the athletic life, education,
publicity, automobiling.”</p>

<p>“Popular elements, anyway,” said Willys.
“Automobiling as a substitute for which of the
Thirty-nine Articles, Professor?” I glanced to see
if Cornelia were listening; but she was plucking at
a holly wreath in the window and seemed intent on
the street.</p>

<p>“It is a vital element of our popular religion,” I
insisted, “and by no means so absurd a substitute
as you suppose. One has got to take together, you
see, this whole group of genuine popular beliefs.
Next one asks every honest average man if he
doesn’t agree that these things are what he wants
and believes in, and that the group of them
expresses what our modern civilization wants and
believes in. Then one turns on the average man
and says: ‘This, sir, is your effective Shorter
Catechism; and you’ve got to junk whiskey as
your national drink, because it is just flatly
incompatible with the general distribution of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</span>
the objects of your religion.’ That’s the way his
religion reconciles him to his necessity.”</p>

<p>“I had a hunch, Professor,” said Willys, who had
long since grown weary of serious argument, “that
automobiling and drinking went together.”</p>

<p>“They have hitherto,” I said, “but—”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="VI-4">VI<br>
I DISCUSS THE ETHICS OF AN
AUTOMOBILING CIVILIZATION</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">My speech was cut short at that point by Cornelia
at the window, calling out rather sharply:—</p>

<p>“Oliver, why do you suppose the children don’t
come?” Almost in the same breath she sprang to
her feet and, pulling aside the curtain, cried:—</p>

<p>“Oh! Oh! Oliver, what’s that?” And an instant
later, “Oh! Oh! Oh! How dreadful! Thank
God! Thank God! Oh, thank God, it’s not the
children!”</p>

<p>“Of course not!” soothed Oliver, with his arm
about her shoulder. “Of course not. What was it?
Tell us about it.”</p>

<p>We ourselves had heard, not indistinctly,—the
apartment is on the second floor,—the prolonged
steady screech of an automobile horn, and,
in response to Cornelia’s cry, had rushed to her
side, expecting, I suppose, to see the fire department
clearing its right of way up the avenue.</p>

<p>“Oh, there’s been a dreadful accident,” cried
Cornelia. “That poor little boy—Oh, that poor
little boy! They were driving like mad—to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span>
hospital, I suppose. I saw two policemen standing
on the running-board of an open car coming up the
street, and another sitting on the front seat by the
driver. Then, for just an instant, as it flashed into
the bright light under the windows, I could see
that the policeman in front was holding in his arms
a little boy—seven or eight years old—with his
head, face upward, hanging over the edge of the
car—bright red with blood—absolutely one
bright red disc of blood—and streaming. Oh, it
was horrible! You have no idea how horrible!
And then, as it went past, I could see that there
was a woman crumpled over in the rear seat, and
an old man trying to hold her up.”</p>

<p>“It must have been a shock,” Willys offered;
and I added something equally helpful, as one does
on such occasions.</p>

<p>“Well, my dear,” said Oliver, as we returned to
the fireplace, “accidents, you know, do happen.
Are you calmer now?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Cornelia, “yes, I guess so. I’m
trembling still. You’ve simply no idea how it
shook me.”</p>

<p>She sank into a chair, then recovered herself
sharply, and said with a smile: “I’m sorry. Forgive
me for making such a fuss over it. I’m all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span>
right now. I suppose it’s horrid to be so selfish—but,
oh, Oliver, aren’t you glad it wasn’t the
children? Aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Certainly, my dear!” said Oliver, in such a
droll matter-of-fact tone that we all laughed quite
spontaneously. “And now shall we talk of something
else? Or do you wish me to telephone to
the Infant that their mother has been anxiously
expecting them for at least five minutes?”</p>

<p>“No, don’t telephone,” Cornelia protested.
“It’s really only just after one. I’m sure they will
be here in plenty of time for the train. And please
don’t change the subject. I heard what you were
saying. You were talking about automobiles and
automobile accidents. That is what made me so
‘jumpy,’ I suppose. I’ll not be silly any more.
What were you going to say about automobiles
when I interrupted?”</p>

<p>“It would be hard,” I said, “to avoid ‘improving
the occasion’ a little. Heaven knows I didn’t
get up the accident to illustrate my argument—and
there’s no reason to suppose that it does illustrate
my argument exactly. These people may all
have been perfectly sober. But if this thing, just
now, had happened in a story, like that, we should
have felt that it was contrived and artificial—I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
don’t recall just where I stopped, but what I was
about to say was—the gist of it was, that you can
make a live argument based on our automobiling
civilization, with almost anybody in the United
States, because almost everybody in the United
States has some sort of vital interest in a car; and
so the argument, as we say, comes home to him.”</p>

<p>“That is sound enough,” said Oliver.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “the things that people have in
common are the things that hold them together
and enable them to act together. Cars are a much
more expensive cultural and social amalgam than,
say, abstract fraternity, or a belief in the Apostolic
Church, or even than an old family Bible. But the
fact remains that cars are at present far more
widely diffused and almost infinitely more used
among our fellow countrymen than any of the older
and less expensive amalgams. I doubt whether
there is any other subject whatever upon which our
people possess so large a fund of common knowledge
and experience. Consider: we have fifteen
million cars. That means that perhaps one out of
every six or seven men, women, children, and
babies in this country actually drives a car. That’s
what I call practical belief in an article of the
popular religion. And you see—if you think—that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
it’s the garage and the filling-station that
crowd out the saloon, at every few blocks in the
city, in every town and village, at every crossroads
from Florida to Montana. It’s one—just one,
mind you—of the expensive new clubs of the
plain people, of the average man.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Oliver, “there’s something in that.”</p>

<p>“There’s a good deal in that,” I persisted,
“both for economic necessitarians like you and me,
and for religious enthusiasts like Willys. For
Willys, you remember, the essence of religion is
a kind of dangerous and exciting Bacchic escape
from humdrum into a few hours of heightened
consciousness and mystical fellowship—through
the national drink. Well, Willys, when the half
gods go, the true gods arrive. The national car
does everything that <em>you</em> ask of the Holy Grail:
it provides the average American with an emotional
discharge; it provides him with danger,
excitement, the intoxication of speed, heightened
consciousness, and a mystical sense of fellowship
with the owner of both the Rolls-Royce and the
Ford roadster; and it provides these things not
on Saturday night only but every day in the
year. As you will concede, there is a ‘kick’,
the possibility of a kick—especially in our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</span>
national car—for every day in the year. And
there’s one more thing about the religion and
ritual of the car.”</p>

<p>“Oh at least that!” said Oliver. “But what
is it, Professor?”</p>

<p>“It’s a thing,” I said, “that knocks into a
cocked hat His Excellency’s private argument
for privately nullifying the Eighteenth Amendment.
Of course His Excellency didn’t invent
the argument—I mean that hoary old bore
about personal liberty and private conscience and
so forth. All the ‘wet’ newspapers pull it out
of the Pyramid of Cheops seven times a week.
All the ‘wet’ city newspapers count the German
and Italian and Slavic noses in their constituencies
and then get off that tedious drip about
the ‘puritan minority’ and its attempt to bully
these honest European consciences, which, being
European, are free from sanctimonious scruples
against befuddling their wits with liquor.”</p>

<p>“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quo me rapis, tui plenum</i>—where, O Mid-Western
Bacchus,” cried Oliver, “where dost thou
drag me at the tail of thy car? I feel the thong
going through my heels and the rope running up
to the axle of your Ford. Crank up! Drag on!”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you see, Excellency,” I persisted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</span>
“that the car hauls the whole argument clean
out of the gumbo of ‘personal liberty’—clean
out of the slough of ‘private conscience’? We
don’t know how this accident out here in the
street took place; but in our Mid-Western metropolis
we killed some seven hundred people last
year with cars, and, according to the papers, there
was more than one such accident as this one from
drivers who were drunk. With one out of every
seven men, women, children, and babies in the
United States driving a car at from twenty to forty
miles an hour, along crowded streets and thoroughfares
from Maine to California, we have
simply got to prevent drivers from being drunk.
It’s in the necessity of the situation. We are all
private engineers nowadays. That’s what we want.
Very well. If we all want to be private engineers,
we’ve got to submit to the same regulations as
governed—long since—engineers on the railways.
Our job is not less hazardous than theirs,
but more so. A railway engineer who drinks
is fired by the railroad, and I understand by his
own union.”</p>

<p>“I’m stiff on that,” said His Excellency.
“A man who drives his car when he’s drunk
should be strung up to the nearest telegraph pole.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>“Oh no,” said Willys, “you’re a little hard on
him. You can’t stop a man drinking because he
occasionally drives his car, drunk. Give him a
good fine and take away his license. Or, if he is
very drunk, put him where he can sober up.”</p>

<p>“That wouldn’t,” I said, “quite straighten
things out—would it—for the occupants of
the car that went by here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but Professor, you are so unrealistic,”
said Willys, as he rose and clapped a hand over his
mouth in order to eject a yawn which he could
not swallow. “You are hopelessly unrealistic.
If a man doesn’t drive when he’s drunk, now and
then, how in the dickens is he going to get home?
What time is it?”</p>

<p>“It’s half-past one,” said Cornelia, who had
also risen at the first opportunity. “And there’s
the telephone. See what it is, Oliver—quickly,
quickly! But nothing could have happened to
them—my son is such a careful driver.”</p>

THE VENGEANCE OF DIONYSUS</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Oliver stepped to his desk and removed the
receiver. There was an inevitable moment of
suspense. Then tossing to us with a smile: “It’s
the Infant—they’re all right,” he turned again
to the telephone and listened for nearly five
minutes, during which he said “yes” several times,
“What’s that?” once, and concluded with “I’ll
come immediately.”</p>

<p>Then he faced us with a curious smile, meant
to be reassuring, and, with that promptitude of
thought and action which idle Americans in
Europe are understood to exhibit on the outbreak
of war, said swiftly and decisively:—</p>

<p>“Oliver has been arrested for speeding. I’ll
have to go and bail him out. They are letting
the girls come home. They will be here any
minute. Willys, will you go downstairs to the
office and tell them to send a taxi here at once?
Professor, you go, too, and meet the girls downstairs.
I want to have a word with Cornelia.
If Dorothy comes before I join you, keep her
there a minute. Yes, put on your coats—we’ll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</span>
not come back. Willys and I will look after this
business; the Professor will go on, to his train.”</p>

<p>In the face of a real little emergency Cornelia’s
nerves never betray her. As soon as Oliver began
to give orders, she became the source instead
of the recipient of reassurances, as if her only
anxiety had been for a gracious leave-taking.
She did it extraordinarily well.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The rest of my impressions of that night I
shall drastically telescope because this is not a
story, but a conversation, and my impressions
relate merely to the incident which had intruded
with such coincidental force upon the conversation.</p>

<p>I recall that the first moment in which my
imagination began to link the talk and events of
the evening vividly together was in the elevator,
descending to the ground floor, when Willys,
casually thrusting his hands into the pockets of
his overcoat, and muttering something about His
Excellency’s being a little fussed, fished out his
copy of the <em>Bacchae</em>. As I transferred the book
to my own coat, somehow association shot a
link from the Greek tragedy and its gory scene
in the hills to the red face that Cornelia had seen
under the city lamps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</span></p>

<p>While Willys occupied himself with accelerating
the arrival of a taxi, I went out on the street and
stood on the curb, waiting reflectively enough
for the appearance of Dorothy and her girl friend.
Five minutes later they were driven up. With
the notion that my function was to shut off a
“scene” of any sort, I instantly remarked, in
the quiet tone of a man who understands all
about the situation, that Dorothy’s father was
explaining the thing to her mother, who was a
little agitated, and that he desired them to wait
downstairs till he came down. Both girls looked
as if they had been crying, but they were calm
now, and seemed indisposed to talk to me. When
I had drawn them aside out of observation from
the office, and saw no hysterical signs, I ventured
to ask why they had been driving so fast. The
other girl, whose name I did not catch, said that
they had not been driving fast but had skidded.
Before I could utter my natural question, Dorothy
turned on her young friend, and said:—</p>

<p>“That is not so. You know it is not so.”
Then she did a queer thing. She asked me if I
was leaving town that night, and when I said I
was, she slipped from under her fur coat a small,
light oblong parcel wrapped in a man’s handkerchief,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</span>
thrust it into my hands, and whispered with
singular intensity: “Take it with you, please!
Take it away and pitch it—pitch it where no one
will ever find it!” I dropped it discreetly into my
overcoat pocket. Then Oliver entered from the
elevator, questioned Dorothy for a minute, and
sent the two girls up to Cornelia.</p>

<p>Oliver, Willys, and I then entered the waiting
taxi and drove away. Oliver sat with his back
to the driver, facing us two. I itched to ask him
why the other girl had told me that their car had
skidded, and why Dorothy had denied it. But it
seemed a good time to let Oliver speak first. He sat
for a few moments in a frowning concentration,
almost as if we had not been there. Then he
ejaculated, still as if we had not been there,
“My God, what a mess! My God, what a mess!”
Willys rallied him on making such an ado over
a fine. Then Oliver hurled the whole thing between
our eyes, just as he himself had got it, standing
there so gaily in the library, smiling histrionically
back at us from the telephone. The Infant—he
still referred to him as “the Infant”— had been
arrested on the charge of manslaughter and
driving a car while drunk. He wasn’t drunk,
but he had been drinking a little at the party, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
the other boys had. He had somehow lost control
and hit some people, a woman and a little boy,
he thought, just a few blocks from home.</p>

<p>Well, that is the gist of the incident.</p>

<p>As I look back now on that trip to the police-station,
I am shocked to remember how self-centred
we were, all three. I can’t recall that it
occurred to any one of us to be concerned about
the load of broken humanity that had gone, an
hour earlier, to the hospital. Our sole concern
seemed to be lest a couple of physically uninjured
boys should spend a few hours of the night in
jail. And just before the taxi stopped at the
police-station to let His Excellency and Willys
out, I know that I myself was actually wondering
about this remote point: how it would affect
Cornelia, and whether she would not suffer more
in the injury which her son had inflicted upon
others than if he had himself been injured. But
what I was actually saying was, that I thought
young Oliver did not drink; Cornelia seemed so
sure of him. Oliver Senior exclaimed “Oh rot!”
And then he added:—</p>

<p>“Why, the Infant and the furnace-man made
a keg of raisin wine in the basement of our own
apartment last Easter. He told me about it just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span>
yesterday. I asked him why he hadn’t told me
at the time, since we two were on the square with
each other. He said that he was afraid of setting
me a bad example! Oh, the poor little devil! The
poor little devil!”</p>

<p>Willys said it was “a damn shame” and they
must see what they could do to get the charge of
driving while drunk withdrawn and the charge
of exceeding the speed limit substituted. Then
we shook hands. Oliver and Willys got out, and
I went on to the railway station. I hated not to
stand by and see the thing through. But Oliver
had assured me that I couldn’t really do anything
<em>but</em> stand by; and as I had a speaking
engagement in Ohio on the next day, and my
college work began the day after, I surrendered
to the necessity of the situation. My holiday was
over.</p>

<p>I started westward with little eagerness—with
an odd sensation of repletion and fatigue mixed
with cerebral excitement. “The starved silkworm,”
I muttered to myself, “has had his feast
of mulberry leaves.” I was not sleepy and didn’t
wish to spend the small hours of the morning
tossing in my berth. I went into the empty
dressing-room for a smoke. As I hung up my overcoat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
I thought of the parcel that Dorothy had
entreated me to “pitch—pitch where no one
will ever find it.” Poor pathetic, distracted little
Dorothy! It was only an empty silver flask,
wrapped in her brother’s handkerchief and neatly
engraved with his monogram. Poor little
distracted Bacchante—apparently it hadn’t
occurred to her that the breath of whiskey still
strong in the silver flask was doubtless giving
even stronger evidence elsewhere.</p>

<p>The thing hurt me, and I put it away. Everything
that I tried to think of, however, hurt me.
I wanted to escape from too much sensation. But
my mind was in that state of fatigue-intoxication
in which one seems to be simply an observer of a
succession of pictures which form spontaneously
there. I was conscious of wishing to reflect
consecutively on a certain idea, namely, whether
Willys was right in declaring that one can’t
kill a god. But the moment that I began to grip
the idea, and ask myself whether in the course of
history many terrible old gods and dynasties of
gods had not utterly passed away under the
pressure of that Necessity which encompasses
the gods and is stronger than they—pictures began
to form: Bacchanalian women dancing in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
hills; Willys’s humorous torn limbs of Pentheus
strewn “all over the place”; Cornelia’s terrified
picture of the gory head hanging over the car;
and—the young Bacchus at the police station.</p>

<p>Sometimes one manages to escape from the
persecution of such pictures by reading a book.
I had nothing available but the copy of the
<em>Bacchae</em> that Willys had lent me. When I found
it impossible to escape from its suggestions, I
decided to face them. I read till the gray morning
crept into the car and extinguished the lights.
The last lines of the tragedy moved me deeply,
with a kind of strange solemnity, a haunting
beauty.</p>

<p class="no-indent fs90">O the works of the Gods—in manifold wise they reveal them:<br>
Manifold things unhoped-for the Gods to accomplishment bring,<br>
And the things that we looked for, the Gods deign not to fulfill them;<br>
And the paths undiscerned of our eyes, the Gods unseal them.</p>

<p>I looked out at the window. Another day had
come. We were thundering through wintry cornfields—a
hint of snow on the withered brown
stalks. I rose, and passing through the silent
sleepers to the deserted observation-car at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
rear, I went out on the platform and pitched the
empty silver flask as far as I could pitch it into
the wind. I seemed to hear from the corn a
remembered godlike voice crying: “O celestial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>Bacchus, drive them mad!”</p>

WE MEET IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">It is not my intention to make public, in any
detail, what I know of the means by which His
Excellency got young Oliver out of his New Year’s
scrape in New York. In recording my conversations
with Cornelia and her family, I have been
animated throughout by a desire to increase popular
respect for the members of our upper class as
the suitable persons to give tone to the democracy;
and this particular incident happens not to be
altogether creditable to the ethical sense of His
Excellency—if one uses as a criterion the ethical
austerity of Jeanie Deans or George Washington of
blessed memory. I am not sure that almost any
other man in the same circumstances—even a
member of our very moral middle-class—would
not have strained a point to keep his own son from
public punishment and disgrace. I mean only that
we all talk about “equality before the law,” until
we find ourselves in personal need of special privileges;
and that when His Excellency’s withers were
wrung, he took it as a matter of course that he
should use his money and his persuasive tongue,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</span>
his acquaintance with the police captain, his relationship
with Judge Black, and his influence
with the newspapers to smooth things over. The
matter was adjusted out of court and without
publicity, chiefly by the prepayment, while the
recovery of the principal victim was in doubt, of
the moderate sum which disinterested persons
estimated the life of an eight-year-old boy of the
laboring class to be worth. His Excellency himself
wrote to me, in the latter part of March, as I
remember, that everything had been “fixed up—<em>Gott
sei Dank</em>; so that’s over.”</p>

<p>What immediate effect the accident and the
reparation of it had upon the internal harmony
of Cornelia’s household, I did not know. In the
occasional letters which I had received from her
early in the year, she expressed considerable anxiety
about the health of her son. She said that the
accident was preying on his mind and making him
nervous and listless about his school work—and
perhaps she should have to take him out of school.
In one letter, which she asked me to burn, I thought
that I detected a hint of bitterness toward Oliver
for concealing from her his knowledge that Oliver
Junior had been less innocent of the tastes and
follies of his age than she had imagined him to be.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</span>
But in all the years of our acquaintance, both
she and her husband had maintained a proud and—I
had supposed—happy reticence regarding
their more intimate relations; and except in the
essentially comic incident, last summer, of Dorothy’s
bobbed hair, I had never been admitted to so
much as a glimpse of anything like a domestic
“difference.” Being, myself, an old bachelor with
perhaps somewhat idealistic notions of family life,
it was quite beyond me to conceive that a serious
misfortune, like the automobile accident, could
have any other influence than to cement more
closely the family unity.</p>

<p>I was even so guileless as to suspect nothing,
when, in the middle of April, I received a letter
from Cornelia, saying that Oliver had gone to
Paris for some months to get material for his war
book, <em>Lying Abroad for One’s Country</em>; that she
was taking the children to southern California for
an indefinite sojourn; and that she hoped I might
visit them when my college work was over—there
was something which she wished very much to
talk about. I searched through the letter to see if I
could discover what it was. To my obtuse perceptions,
the point of interest appeared not to be in
the main news but in the incidental reference to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</span>
Cornelia’s religious bias, contained in the following
paragraph:—</p>

<p>“Don’t be afraid,” she wrote, “of going to
southern California in July. The climate is delightfully
right, if only one stays near enough to
the coast. I have been hoping for years to spend a
summer there, but have always had to give it up
because my cousin Ethelwyn lives there! Such a
pity: she has a charming Spanish house—Spanish
with American improvements—in a walnut
grove, with a ‘kitchen garden’ of orange and fig
trees, near a little village ten or fifteen miles north
of San Diego. But she—I have told you something
about her, haven’t I?—she is a Theosophist
or a Bahaist or one of those dreadful things that
Boston Unitarians become infected with when they
live long in California. And the people she has
around her—well, fond as I am of her, I myself
find them impossible; and Oliver always used to
say that he would ‘rather be d——d to all eternity
with Voltaire than spend ten minutes in Heaven
with Ethelwyn.’ Well, poor dear Ethelwyn has just
had a chance to join a pilgrim ship, which is going
by way of China and India to visit some ‘saint’ in—I
think—Arabia; and she has offered me the
place, together with all the servants, for a year.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</span>
My sister Alice will go with me for company. We
shall fumigate and air the place thoroughly! I
have engaged an excellent tutor for the children—a
young man from St. Luke’s School; and we shall
see what can be done to get them back again to
their right minds before they go to college in the
fall. So do come and help us!”</p>

<p>To anyone acquainted with either Cornelia or
California, it should be needless to say that I went.
How I went, may interest the curious. Members of
the poor-professor class have, as they have frequently
explained to the public, many tastes
in common with respectable well-to-do-people—tastes
which of course they are unable to gratify.
But they have one expensive taste, which, with a
little craft, they can indulge almost as fully as
people with something to live on. I refer to their
inclination for running about the country. I shall
always remain in the teaching profession because,
no matter whither a poor professor wishes to travel,
there is always some group of kindly Americans
ready to pay his expenses to and from his base,
provided he will speak to them on any side of any
subject he pleases—loudly and for not more than
fifty minutes. There was, in July, a pretty warm
educational convention in Los Angeles, designed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</span>
keep the State of California educationally well in
the lead of Massachusetts. I spoke on three successive
mornings, expanding an ancient club-paper
into a three-day serial by presenting its platitudes
more slowly and impressively than club custom
permits. However, we are not now concerned
with that.</p>

<p>As I left the auditorium platform on the third
morning, and, in the anteroom, was receiving my
fee, Dorothy and Oliver Junior, bareheaded and
browned by southern sunshine, burst in. “Hello!”
cried Oliver, “car’s outside. This your dunnage?”
Dorothy, on the impulse of the moment, kissed me,
which made me think well of myself, and even
better of her than ever, for twenty-four hours
afterwards. I was wondering how Oliver felt
about driving, when Dorothy jumped in and,
taking the wheel, sent me to the rear seat with
her brother.</p>

<p>We worked our way cautiously out of the congested
somnolent city, which expands its amorphous
immensity while it sleeps. Then the efficient
young pilot whirled us along at high speed over the
four- or five-hour trip, through orange groves and
highways lined with palms, by sea and sandy waste,
through pines and pale-gold grass, past San Juan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</span>
Capistrano, gorgeous with flowers, across the mesa
by the old Mission road, to the outskirts of La
Jolla, then, with a sharp turn up a little valley,
into a cool sea-freshened wilderness of green
walnut trees among which, cream-yellow, flat-roofed,
Santo Espiritu emerges, couched against
the foothills of Mount Soledad.</p>

OLIVER JUNIOR DISCUSSES HIS PARENTS,
THEIR RELIGION, AND HIS OWN</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">I did not see these things which I have just
mentioned; I only remembered them vaguely afterward.
Almost as soon as we had seated ourselves
in the car, we began to talk about a subject which
put landscape quite out of my head. Young Oliver,
I might say in passing, is a ready talker with
something of the startling candor of his father.
I should perhaps add that his preparation for
college along with his sister, who is two years
younger, is due to the irregularity of his preparatory-school
work—interrupted by a period of
nearly two years’ service as His Excellency’s
private secretary in Europe.</p>

<p>Ruminating on the possible length of my visit
at Santo Espiritu, I had remarked, “I suppose
your father will come out later in the year.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he won’t,” said Oliver. “I suspect
he intends to live in Paris.”</p>

<p>“Intends to do what?” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“To live abroad somewhere. I suppose you
know that my father and mother have separated.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</span></p>

<p>“Nonsense, Ollie,” Dorothy shouted back over
her shoulder. “You know you don’t believe that!
They always separate in the summer.”</p>

<p>“That’s true,” said her brother. “Dad always
had to have a vacation from the family. He always
took one whenever, as he used to say to us, ‘Your
mother is growing too good to be true. I’ve got to
have a rest.’ But other summers they have agreed
to separate—peaceably—by collusion. This
time father went off in a flaming huff. And I
don’t think my mother is in a mood to ask him
back again. Their relations have been severely
strained.”</p>

<p>“Oliver,” I said, “you are your father over again
for diabolical badinage. Cut it out, please. Tell
me seriously what you are talking about.”</p>

<p>“I’m as serious,” he replied, “as a great horned
owl. Dolly and I have reasoned earnestly with
them both. But our parents are hard people to
deal with on a rational basis. My mother has
principles, you know; and it’s no use talking to
people with principles. And my father, when he
gets in a huff, is as obstinate as a mule.”</p>

<p>“Come now,” I urged with a little irritation,
“is there anything in this, at all? What was the
huff about?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</span></p>

<p>“Well—a huff, you know,” instructed the
wise youth, “is just the kettle boiling over, after
it has been heated a long time. I’m afraid it all
goes back to my New Year’s scrape; but it goes
back of that to other sins of mine—and maybe
Dorothy’s—that father knew about and she
didn’t; and it goes back of that to the big quarrel
between the ancients and the moderns. Father
is on the modern side—at least he wants to be.
My mother is all for the good old ways. So, you
see, there’s a fundamental incompatibility.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “I understand all that; but tell
me about the huff.”</p>

<p>Oliver leaned forward and spoke in his sister’s
ear. She nodded. Then he said:—</p>

<p>“Well, the fact is that he and mother hadn’t
been hitting it off at all this spring. Dolly and I
both noticed it months ago. We were all more or
less strung up; and they got on each other’s
nerves—noticeably. My mother is—well you
know how my mother is, ordinarily.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do,” I said; “your mother has the most
perfect temper in the world. Go on.”</p>

<p>“Ordinarily, yes,” testified her son; “but when
she gets a thing on her mind, or her conscience,
or wherever it is, she never lets it rest. She is that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</span>
way. She gets sort of keyed up or wound up or
whatever it is, and then she goes off like an alarm
clock. When she gets excited, father begins to
jest, and he keeps his head for a while. But she
sticks at him till he stops jesting; and then he gets
more excited than she is; and then—it’s all up.”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“Well, all spring mother had been dinning at
him—”</p>

<p>“Oh, get out!” I exclaimed, “Your mother
doesn’t ‘din.’”</p>

<p>“Oh, doesn’t she! Doesn’t she! Very well.
All spring, mother had been gently speaking to
dad at rather frequent intervals about his not
backing her up in her ideas for Dolly’s and my
salvation. Of course you understand that young
people of our age are always in danger of heading
for the City of Destruction.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s obvious enough,” I said.</p>

<p>“Well, one day I overheard them at it—overheard
my mother gently reminding my father
about me. She said to him: ‘I warned you and
warned you and warned you, that if you didn’t
take a father’s part and back me up, Oliver would
get into trouble; but you just laughed and encouraged
him. Now see what you have brought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</span>
on us.’ That subject wasn’t very pleasant to any
of us in the first place; and my father had got
sick of it in the form of cold hash. Dad said:
‘Here beginneth the ninety-ninth lesson!’ Mother
said: ‘But you have got to take a father’s part.’
Dad said: ‘As it was in the beginning: I don’t
want to hear any more about that.’ Mother repeated
precisely the same thing in different words.
He said: ‘Look here! I thought we had agreed to
let that subject rest.’ Mother varied the phrase
and presented her thought again. Father exclaimed:
‘Don’t repeat that! Are you crazy?’
Mother instantly replied: ‘You never, never, back
me up. You never do a father’s part. And now
see this horrible, horrible thing you have got us
into!’ Father began to lose his temper; and as
soon as he does that, she seems possessed with
a desire to see how far she can make him go.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“All right, you needn’t. But you wouldn’t
forget if you had ever heard it. Mother said it
again—the same thing identically, only with a
little more sting in it. Then dad began to swear;
but he always hates himself for a week afterward
when he does, so he pulled himself up, and told
her to stop or he didn’t know what he’d do.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</span>
Well, I sat still and counted, and my mother
jabbed him in the wound nine times in all by
actual count with that identical taunt. Then
poor old dad, who had been stalking back and
forth like the tiger over in Balboa Park, bolted
without a word. He went down to Washington
for a couple of days. When he came back, he
just quietly announced that he was going to Paris.
‘You may say, to work on my book—for an
indefinite period.’ Mother said in her most impervious
manner: ‘Very well, then: go.’ Father
replied,—as frosty as a wedding cake,—‘Thank
you, I will.’ Then they both bowed. It was like
a play. Dorothy and I came in from the wings
and offered friendly mediation; in vain. Father
packed up and went. Dolly and I don’t think
either of them is quite sensible.”</p>

<p>“H-m,” I said reflectively, “h-m-m—What
is your mother doing now?”</p>

<p>“Why she’s done—we’ve all done—California
from Mount Shasta to Tia Juana, specializing
on the Missions and the juniper trees
from Palestine that the padres planted. But now
we’re doing religion. We’ve settled down in
Santo Espiritu with Aunt Alice and our tutor,—Dolly
and I call him Father Blakewell to his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</span>
face and the Holy Father behind his back;
he’s going to be an Anglican monk, you know,—we’ve
settled down to do religion, mainly, and get
ready for college, incidentally. Mother is really
‘doing’ it; Dolly and I—well, we ‘assist,’ in the
French sense. We study a little, and go to church
a lot, and swim in the afternoon, and play mah
jongg after dinner; and the Holy Father reads
prayers in the morning on week days and twice
on Sundays; and Mother is reading Newman’s
<em>Idea of a University</em> aloud, and she goes to early
communion, and fasts on saints’ days, and is a
member of the altar guild—and she is taking
in laundry.”</p>

<p>“Taking in what?” I ejaculated.</p>

<p>“Taking in laundry. She has consecrated her
hands to the Church. She washes the rector’s
vestments and things. You know she always had
a kind of passion for keeping things clean—souls
and bodies and so on. So this job just hits her
fancy now, and ‘fills her life,’ you know. When
we started for Los Angeles this morning, she was
ironing the vestments, and, believe me, when I
saw her bending over the ironing-board, she looked
so perfectly blissful that I—I pitied her. It seems
kind of daffy to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</span></p>

<p>Though the painter was satirical, the picture,
to my fond imagination, was delightful. I saw
her—herself all in white—bending her golden
head over the snowy linen, her hands moving
smoothly; it would be a very special iron, silver
perhaps. She would do it beautifully, adorably.
I should be reminded of some early Italian saint;
and all the æsthetic Christianity in me would
enjoy a kind of Pre-Raphaelite resurrection.</p>

<p>“H-m,” I repeated helplessly. I hadn’t the
faintest notion how to treat the idea with any
profit to a young fellow of Oliver’s age and point
of view. It simply wasn’t in his experience, and
I didn’t see how to put it there. His fondness for
his mother, his complete detachment from her
religious interests, his absolute incomprehension
of her position appalled me. One can reason with
an earnest young intellectual rebel, occasionally
to some effect. But an amused young seraph in
Oliver’s state, contemplating his mother with
kindly compassion from his pinnacle of intellectual
certitude and religious inexperience—one can’t
even draw such a person to the portals of argument.</p>

<p>“I hope,” I said, “you and Dorothy are behaving
yourselves at home, as well as you know how.”</p>

<p>“Oh yes,” he replied, “we are being good,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</span>
aren’t we, Dolly? Wait till you hear us after
dinner discussing with the Holy Father about the
existence of angels, and the Apostolic Succession,
and the priority of Persons in the Blessed Trinity.
Dorothy and I got together and decided it was
up to us to mortify our sinful flesh by holding
our tongues this summer. Even father used to
do that, most of the time, so far as religion is
concerned; and it was harder for him than it
is for us.”</p>

<p>“How was that?”</p>

<p>“Oh, father, you know, doesn’t believe in
anything. He calls himself an ‘old Voltairean,’
and he reads Herbert Spencer and Nietzsche and
Henry Adams. But he really doesn’t believe in
anything but chaos and the ‘struggle for survival’
and the ‘degradation of energy.’ We believe in
plenty of things.”</p>

<p>“Do you really!” I exclaimed, genuinely delighted.
“That’s good. Tell me what they are.”</p>

<p>“Well, in religious matters we agree with father
as little as with mother. He is always talking
about ‘jungle ethics’ and ‘the law of survival.’
He thinks he is the only realist. But that is old
stuff, and it doesn’t sound good to us. We don’t
fall for the cave-man line of aristocracy that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</span>
Dreiser and Mencken and Lawrence and those
fellows are trying to bring in.”</p>

<p>“Where do you get your line?”</p>

<p>“Oh, out of books and talk and out of the air;
some of it we think out ourselves, and a little of
it we get from Hoover and Lane and what father
calls the ‘Western roughneck crowd.’ Since January,
we’re teetotalers; and father, of course, is
only a prohibitionist. Then we’re sick of war—we
don’t think it’s sensible; and we’re sick of
supermen; and we’re sick of belonging to the
‘privileged class.’ We believe in the real square
deal and good sportsmanship and common sense
and common decency and health and hygiene and
science and beauty—and a lot of things like that.
Of course, father and mother pretend that they
do, too—in a way. But we are radical democrats,
I guess; and father and mother are both snobs.”</p>

<p>Dorothy, listening to as much as she could
catch from the steering wheel, called back:—</p>

<p>“Father isn’t a snob—mother is.”</p>

<p>“You are wrong, Dolly,” said her brother;
“they are both snobs. We are really interested
in the People. Neither of them cares two straws
for anyone outside their own class—except, of
course, that father has a personal friend here and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</span>
there among the cab-drivers and the police.
He thinks that he is being like Roosevelt. And
that he’s like Roosevelt when he goes around
among the ‘peasantry,’ as he calls them, whooping
it up for big families, and patting them on the
back for having eighteen little morons, and making
it a crime to tell them how to get a chance to
live like civilized beings.”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard your father say very sensible
things about that. You do him an injustice.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t. We believe in telling people the
truth; and in finding out first what it is. Father
believes in making a Federal statute first, to keep
the peasantry peasants, and busy propagating
mill-hands and soldiers; and then in violating it
himself as he sees fit. Father is personally interested
in the truth, and he really knows a lot
about it; but he wouldn’t dream of telling it to
anyone but an intimate friend—he doesn’t
think it’s safe. And mother doesn’t think it’s
decent. Besides, she hates like sin to admit even
to herself the existence of any fact that doesn’t
fit into her vision of a ‘nice’ world. She likes to
sit on the shore and order the sea back. She
really enjoys deceiving herself, and is pretty good
at it. Father isn’t like that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</span></p>

<p>“So you side with him there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, except that father is a sort of double
personality. Privately, you know, dad is a
cynical cosmopolitan, and he thinks America is
a hick joint except for half a dozen of his own
cronies. But you know how he stands in public,
wrapping the flag around him, and doing the big
bowwow at Japan and Mexico, and standing pat
with the pattest element of the Grand Old Party’s
patriots. Dad knows who cuts the melons. Dolly
and I are sick of that. We want to come in on
the ground floor and on the square. We want to
have careers that we have made for ourselves, and
not be handed something on a silver plate by one
of father’s friends. Then we are sort of sick of this
‘cosmopolitan’ stuff—which means only that
you hate your own things and can’t even smoke
American tobacco unless it’s been imported from
England. We’ve got so tired of it that we are going
to organize a new party with Flapjacks and
Ham and Eggs for our slogan. The fact is, we get
a sort of kick out of our feeling for the country—as
our own, you know, a poor thing but our own;
and we want to try and see if we can’t be honest-to-goodness
Americans before we die—if you
understand what I mean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</span></p>

<p>“Bully for you!” I cried, in spite of my neutral
intentions.</p>

<p>“But mother,” he continued, “has been reading
the Barsetshire novels all summer, and Trollope
always makes her homesick for the ‘old home.’
She is crazy anyway over the English cathedral
towns, and hopes to be buried in one when she
dies. And just now she’s got a kind of Golden-Age
complex. She hopes to save me from the
democracy by sending me to one of the old
Eastern colleges, where I shall associate with
‘young gentlemen’ from Anglicized prep schools,
and live in a Gothic dormitory, and be tutored by
Rhodes scholars, who are mostly nuts. Dorothy
and I have decided that we want to go to a State
University and get acquainted with the Plain
People. And so mother carries us off to Santo
Espiritu and segregates us with the Holy Father,
in the hope that the seeds of grace and exclusiveness
will take root in our unsanctified hearts.”</p>

<p>“She is ‘getting results’!” I said to myself; and
then aloud: “But don’t you like California?”</p>

<p>“Sure!” he said, with his father’s flickering
smile. “Who wouldn’t? It’s just the place to
go to Heaven in. But it doesn’t seem like our
own old Yankee Land out here. No one hurries.
No one but the Japanese farmer does a lick of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</span>
work—that’s why they hate him so. The white
people just sit around and wait for the Mid-Westerners
to bring them their savings. Unless you
are descended from a Forty-niner, no one cares
who your grandfather was, or whether you are a
Mormon or a Christian Scientist or a Presbyterian
or a Seventh Day Adventist. All the best things
in the State are public property and are out of
doors where everyone can get at them. There
isn’t any ‘Main Street.’ A few of them keep
office hours, but they picnic going to and fro; and
up in San Francisco the business men take a
sea trip every morning and evening. It all feels
like a late afternoon in Arcadia.”</p>

<p>I glanced at my watch and remarked that we
must be near Santo Espiritu.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Oliver; “but let me tell you a little
more about the Native Sons. They are having
an influence on Dolly’s and my religious beliefs.
They get so much harmless pleasure out of the
world. They sit around eating apricots and looking
at the poppy fields most of the time. When
they are very energetic, they get up and recite
their own verses, or they go into the redwoods and
stage a forest play, or, maybe, do some Greek
dances in the almost-altogether, interpreting the
Song of Solomon or the Eden story. When they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</span>
weary of improving their minds with art and song,
the whole white population goes camping up
around Tahoe or hiking in the high Sierras or
motoring down to Coronado or sword-fishing
over at Catalina. Easterners and Midlanders who
come here late in life easily get mixed up, they
tell me, in these new religions, the way Cousin
Ethelwyn did; but the real Californian doesn’t
take interest in the future life. The present is
good enough for him. ‘Wasn’t it too bad,’ I
heard one of them say, ‘that Saint John didn’t
see Santa Barbara before he wrote <em>Revelation</em>’!
And Dorothy and I have sort of reasoned it out
that the so-called decay of religion in our generation
is rather complimentary to Providence,
indicating that we haven’t got such a grouch as
some of those old boys had against the land that
the Lord gave to our fathers.”</p>

<p>“That is a discussible point of view,” I admitted.</p>

<p>“But here,” he said, “is where we turn off
from the main road. It’s only a little way now.
You’ll see, before you’ve been five minutes in
Santo Espiritu, what a colony of aliens we are,
practising our austerities in our august retreat
on the outskirts of these careless worldlings.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="III-5">III<br>
TABLE TALK AT SANTO ESPIRITU</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">I had been having a curiously disquieting premonition—primarily
the result of Oliver’s indiscreet
betrayal of intimate family matters—that
Cornelia must have been gravely altered by
the shocks and strains of the preceding seven
months. She might seem almost a stranger, I
thought; and as we plunged into the walnut grove
and I caught a glimpse in the distance of the
broad yellowish-white front of the villa, and
knew that in a few seconds I should see her, I
was conscious of a caved-in feeling, together
with a tension of the nerves, such as Enoch
Arden experienced on turning into his garden
walk after a protracted absence. But so far as
the eye could see, there was absolutely nothing
in my premonition.</p>

<p>As we drew up before the door of Santo
Espiritu, she waved to us from an open window
and flew out to meet us, with her incredible, indescribable
air of a young girl, and in a certain very
simple blue gown, or the replica of a blue gown
in which I had remarked last summer that she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</span>
looked like a bluebird. Cornelia, as I had known
her, had at least three principal moods: her winter
mood, in which she was His Excellency’s hostess,
and the note was a quite mature graciousness;
her summer mood, in which she was the children’s
mother, and the note was high ethical solicitude;
and her country walking mood, in which she
reverted to the appearance of seventeen, and the
note approached caprice. When I saw the blue
gown,—maybe it was a ‘frock,’—I said to myself,
“She is in her country walking-mood!”</p>

<p>She greeted me with bright gayety, untinged,
so far as I could perceive, by suppressed feeling.
Then she led me through a spacious hall and across
a magnificent area of Navajo rugs into a pleasant
dusky living-room, where I made the acquaintance
of her sister Alice, an agreeably quiet woman
with peaceful eyes, and the children’s tutor, Mr.
Blakewell, a young fellow with extraordinarily
courteous manner and easy conversation, but
with the ascetic pallor and the faded iris which
one associates with “spirituality.”</p>

<p>I shall not dwell on these minor figures in the
scene. They interested me only as notes of the
background in which Cornelia had developed a
fourth mood, which was new to me.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</span></p>

<p>As soon as the travelers had removed their dust,
we all met for an early dinner. This was served
in the suave air under the sky canopy of the patio
or inner court—a delightful place, equipped with
a fireplace against chilly evenings, and partly
tiled and spread with Indian rugs; on three sides
there was a narrow strip of lawn fringed with
roses and sweet-smelling shrubs; wistaria and
myrtle and some flaming-blossomed vine tapestried
the walls and rambled over the roof and
festooned the wide archway on the west, which
opened into a walled garden, green beneath a
spraying fountain—the removal of the fountain
from the patio to the garden being one of the
“American improvements.”</p>

<p>“Father” Blakewell murmured a Latin grace
upon the repast and, in the course of the meal,
quoted us some of the rules of an English Benedictine
monastery in which he had sojourned.
This, I assume, was less to asperse us with the
odor of sanctity than with the elements of Latin,
which the young people maintained was an unnecessary
burden. “Every man,” said Oliver,
“should know American; then, if he feels the need
of a ‘second language,’ let him study English.”
But the children rather took the lead in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</span>
conversation announcing that, in honor of Saint
Mary of the Sea, the family had adopted a fish
diet, and that they had made a penitential hymn,
which they at once proceeded to chant. It ran
something like this:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">To-day’s Monday,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">To-day’s Monday,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Monday, barracuda,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Tuesday, mackerel,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wednesday, flounder—</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">and so forth. The only other scraps of the table
talk which I retain are connected with Cornelia’s
amused and amusing summary of a letter from
Ethelwyn, who had visited her “Arabian saint”
and reported that the leader of her party, an ex-Evangelical
clergyman from Nebraska, who spoke
only English and had never before been outside the
United States, had, on being addressed by the
saint in Arabic, understood perfectly everything
that was said to him.</p>

<p>“My Lord!” Oliver exclaimed,—“I beg your
pardon,—By Pollux! I wish I could get up my
Vergil that way!” Dorothy said that she didn’t
understand why her mother and the rest of them
made so much fun of Cousin Ethelwyn: it seemed
to her, she said demurely, “very much like
Pentecost.” Father Blakewell explained the distinction,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</span>
but I have forgotten just what it was.
I infer that the children were cutting up a little
on my account; for Oliver followed his sister
with a grave-faced remonstrance against their
“bigotry” toward the new mystical Oriental cults:
they had something, he said, which people seemed
to want; and, for his part, though he didn’t care
for the style of their prophets, he thought there
was a lot of common-sense in some of the Bahaist
notions about world peace and about bringing
forward the common ethical basis of all the great
first-class religions.</p>

<p>“But Oliver dear,” said Cornelia, “you really
wouldn’t care for these Orientals, if you had to
associate with them. They are so—well, I
suppose some of them may be clean. But for a
really well-bred, intelligent woman, like Ethelwyn,
to go trailing around the world after an
ignorant barefooted Arabian peasant seems to me
to be almost disgusting—it’s so—so eccentric.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” replied her son, “that well-bred
Romans of the first century felt very much
as you do when Saint Paul, the humpbacked
tailor of Tarsus, tried to introduce his Levantine
fanaticisms into the Forum.”</p>

<p>“Oliver! That, you know, was very different,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</span>
said Cornelia. “Saint Paul was in the central
religious tradition of the world: what Newman
calls the ‘classical’ religion, the formative power
in what he calls our ‘classical’ Western civilization.
It means so much to be central and not
eccentric.”</p>

<p>“Was Saint Paul ‘central’ when he appeared
in Rome?” asked the incorrigible youth.</p>

<p>“You answer him, Mr. Blakewell,” said Cornelia.</p>

<p>“I think,” said the young man quietly and
seriously, “that Saint Paul was central wherever
he appeared.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said Oliver.</p>

<p>At the same instant he and Dorothy exchanged
winks; and all this arguing abruptly ceased.
Then we strolled into the garden, where I was
urged to light my cigar. We examined the water
lilies under the fountain, and the various exotic
plants which Ethelwyn’s gardeners had persuaded
to perfume the air. Cornelia put a sprig
of heliotrope in my buttonhole, smilingly quoting
a line of <em>The Winter’s Tale</em> about flowers for my
“time of day.” Presently the children, with
Father Blakewell and their Aunt Alice, returned
to the court, where the mah jongg outfit had
been set out in place of the dinner-table and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</span>
little fire of cedar wood had been lighted, more
for its social fragrance than from any need of it.
Soon we heard a pleasant chatter of “seasons”
and “green dragons” and “characters.”</p>

<p>It was a pleasant picture, as we looked in on
it through the archway. We stood there together
for a moment, her shoulder just brushing my
sleeve, and we seemed both to be studying the
scene, like—I sentimentalized it long afterward—like
a pair of happy parents fondly watching
their children at play. We seemed both to be
thinking of the same thing; but I know that
we were not; for I myself was thinking what a
wonderful chatelaine Cornelia was, and what
elaborate properties she really required for the
adequate staging of her part in life, and what an
unutterable fool any poor professor would be who
should think that, if he picked up that little
exquisite body by my side, he could carry off
Cornelia, and make her his own. What I loved in
her, I said to myself in a kind of bittersweet
paroxysm of realization, was paradoxically <em>not in
her</em>; it was the charming world which she had the
gift of creating around her; and it would require
a caravan of elephants to provide her with suitable
accessories for the lodging of a single night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</span></p>

<p>“And now,” said Cornelia, recalling me from
my swift revery, “if you don’t mind walking so
soon after dinner, I’m going to take you down to
the sea—for the sunset.” She glanced at me sidewise
and upward from gray eyes which deliciously
feigned serious question about the words which
her lips were framing: “Do you mind?”</p>


<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="IV-5">IV<br>
A SILENCE BY THE SEA</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">It is a half hour’s walk from Santo Espiritu to
the sea.</p>

<p>As we went through the gate of the walled
garden into the walnut grove, Cornelia patted my
arm lightly, like a shy, affectionate, approving
child, and said softly: “I’m so glad you came.”</p>

<p>“And I.”</p>

<p>“But let’s not talk about that yet. Let’s walk
first. I do hope there will be a fine sunset. We
have them here so seldom. This evening it looks
right.”</p>

<p>We walked on swiftly, chatting of nothings;
through the trees; a short distance along the
Santo Espiritu valley road; then up a steepish
path to the tufted gopher-burrowed mesa; and
across it and down it through zigzags among the
sagebrush and thorny gray shrubs toward the
ocean, over which hung a dull gray curtain of
cloud. There was nothing bright in the scene but
the “bluebird gown” of Cornelia, flitting down
the gray-lichened slope ahead of me. But the
dull blue expanse of the sea brightened a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</span>
as we crossed a strip of level ground at the foot
of the mesa and came to a stand on the edge of a
long crescent-shaped bluff. I looked out at the
fishing boats anchored a quarter of a mile from
shore.</p>

<p>“Look down!” said Cornelia. “This is one of
our show places. And you’d better sit down, if
you are dizzy at all.”</p>

<p>We both sat and peered over the undercut rim
of the bluff. Fifty feet below us was the sea,
deep, still, emerald green, transparent and quivering
with waves of pale green light, down into
misty recesses where its depth rendered it opaque.
Up through the floating foliage of the seaweed,
goldfish were swimming idly, big ones in the
grand style, tremendously decorative, and thoroughly
conscious, I thought, of the stunning
effect of their gold in the green water. I was
fascinated by them. I stretched myself flat, face
downward, and pulled myself to the rim and
studied them. A damnable thought was swimming
up to me out of submarine caverns of “the
unplumbed salt estranging sea.”</p>

<p>At first my thought had no shape. It merely
stirred in dark obscurity, like an irritated squid
or devilfish. Then it emerged—with a golden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</span>
head, like a mermaid’s. I am not ordinarily fanciful
or figurative. I dislike fanciful people. But
I have somehow got to convey the idea that, as
I watched those goldfish, the wires in my mind
became crossed and tangled and, for a moment,
made some sort of horrid imaginative connection
between goldfish and mermaids and the enchantingly
girlish figure and golden head of the woman
whose gray eyes I felt but could not see, playing
over my prostrate body and working some charm
at the back of my neck. Cornelia had everything—yes,
everything: the virtues and the graces,
and a beauty and blitheness which often seemed
enough in themselves, they made one so immediately,
unmistakably glad to be alive within their
radius. But wouldn’t she have profited—as
Arnold once remarked of the ladies of the English
aristocracy, whom Cornelia admires so much—wouldn’t
she have profited by “a shade more of
soul”? Was there much—inside, under those
golden scales? Wasn’t she pretty near the surface?
And was that her fault or her misadventure?</p>

<p>“Do you find them interesting?” asked Cornelia.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I replied, continuing my study.</p>

<p>In spite of her nearly grown children, there
was something virginal in Cornelia. Something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</span>
curiously undeveloped; was it, perhaps, her heart?
That would be like a mermaiden. She was no
Circe, I mused, guilefully weaving subtle spells.
She was an otherwise mature woman who had
somehow remained essentially innocent and child-hearted,
singing still to herself, in her “secret
garden,” the songs of seventeen. She herself did
not know, she could not know, what strains of
richer harmony had been lost to her ears—and
to mine, because we had never emerged from the
walled garden, had not dared to venture together
into the “dark forest” of experience. She herself
was an undeveloped theme, a divine fragment of
melody, which the winds hummed and the sea
sang, and which hovered all days and all nights
in the tenebrous deeps of my enchanted heart.</p>

<p>“Look up now,” said Cornelia softly.</p>

<p>I wriggled back from the verge of the bluff, and
sat up, and looked up.</p>

<p>While I had been lying there in prone contemplation
of the goldfish, the awaited sunset had
arrived, and with a magnificence of splendor
unparalleled in my memory. The sun itself was
not visible. But the dull gray curtain, which, as
we were descending the mesa, hung from the
zenith to the sea, had vanished before the passionate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</span>
resurgency of light. Overhead, extending from
north to south, stretched a vast skyland of royal
purple, its lower edge, or shore, tinged with deep
rose color, where the waves of light beat against
it. Near the “shore” was a bright clear crystalline
tract, without any cloud; but elsewhere,
farther out in that celestial sea, gleamed, glowed,
burned an immense archipelago of golden islands.
It looked like Polynesia transfigured with fire and
praising God on the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p>It took my breath away. I gazed spellbound,
like the spellbound color in the sky, to which
Cornelia had called my attention just as it reached
its brief period of seeming fixed and changeless
and eternal. I turned to her. She was quietly
watching my response to her sunset. Our eyes
met; and for an instant they clinched. Then her
lids drooped, and she said:—</p>

<p>“You were so good to come!”</p>

<p>“So good? So good?” I repeated gropingly.
“I don’t know whether I am good or not. I am
happy that I came. I only know that I am very
happy. Is that a sign of goodness, Cornelia?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, and her eyes met mine again
and held them prisoners, while she went past them
looking for something behind them, and I went<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</span>
past her eyes, also in search. We said nothing.
The sea was still. There was not a sound from the
bare brown land between us and the mesa.</p>

<p>Suddenly, out on the bare brown land, a meadowlark
sent up her little bubbling fountain of song—once,
twice. Then she was still. We smiled at
each other as the echoes of the bird’s good-night
reverberated through our nerves and died away.
Then the silence fell, deeper than before. It was
delightful at first. Then it became oppressive,
exciting. It clutched at one’s heart and made it
thud. Or was it something else—something that
had stolen up, in the silence, between us?</p>

<p>Cornelia broke the spell. “Did you hear it?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“The meadowlark, do you mean?”</p>

<p>“No. Of course you heard that!”</p>

<p>“What else—should I have heard?”</p>

<p>“Well, never mind that just now. I want you
to tell me something else. How much—how much
did the children tell you?”</p>

<p>“Everything.”</p>

<p>“I hoped they would; I hoped they would.”</p>

<p>“Then it’s true, Cornelia?”</p>

<p>“What is true?”</p>

<p>“That you and Oliver have separated.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</span></p>

<p>“Oh—that? That is a minor matter.”</p>

<p>“Minor? How minor?” I exclaimed in some
bewilderment.</p>

<p>“Why, compared with other experiences. I
wasn’t thinking about Oliver just now. It’s a
horrid thing to say; but I’m not interested in
Oliver just now. We’ve always been separated—in
a sense. And just now, I feel as if he didn’t
belong to me, nor I to him; as if he were someone
that I had known once, and didn’t know any
more.”</p>

<p>“How did it happen, Cornelia?—I don’t mean
what the children told me. But the rest of it—if
you—if you want me to know.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she said, “I do want you to know, because—well,
I want you to understand. You
know that I was not in love with Oliver when I
married him. I liked him very much. I do now,
in a way. But I married him because he offered
me the life that I wanted, then, and that my
father and mother thought suitable. And I gave
him, at least for a long time, what he wanted—mainly—of
a wife: a woman who would look well
in public with him, and entertain his friends, and
be the mother of his children. When the children
were little, we were closer together, for a few years,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</span>
than we have ever been since. Still, as time went
on, of course we accumulated ‘things in common’—actual
things and experiences and acquaintances;
and as many of them—nearly all of them—were
nice things and pleasant acquaintances and
agreeable experiences, I was not dissatisfied; and
I began to believe there wasn’t much more to be
had from life than just the kind of satisfaction
I had found. I believed, or pretended to believe,
what you were saying last summer: that the ‘inner
life’ is of small consequence, and that everything
that is precious can be—what did you call it?—‘externalized,’
‘objectified.’ Do you really
believe it yourself?”</p>

<p>“I try to keep in mind,” I explained, “all that
can be said for that theory. It is a kind of compromise,
a second-best sort of theory, which many
of us have to accept, when we are starving, or
when a death takes place in the inner chamber of
our lives. That’s what our wits are for, isn’t it—to
help us put up gracefully with what we have to
put up with—grace or no grace?”</p>

<p>“But the theory is worthless,” cried Cornelia;
“it’s absolutely worthless, when one is in trouble,
in serious trouble! I suppose I have had less of it
than anyone I know. As I look over my life before<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</span>
this year, it seems like a dream, it has been so easy
and so fortunate. But when trouble does come,—illness,
death, and that sort of thing,—one
has to have inner resources. Oliver has no inner
resources. Oliver hates trouble, and illness, and
pain; and, whenever he can, he runs away from
them. When he is sick himself, he acts like an untrained
child. He is terrified and certain that he
is going to die; he is really dreadfully afraid of
death—his own death, or the death of anyone
he is fond of.”</p>

<p>“That is interesting,” I said. “I didn’t suppose
that at bottom Oliver took anything seriously.”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t,” said Cornelia, “except <em>that</em>—trouble
to himself, I mean, and to a few others
whom he regards as part of himself. As for anyone
else, he is always saying, ‘It is easy to bear the
misfortunes of others.’ Generally speaking, he
isn’t serious about anything. When he isn’t in a
fit of being pessimistic and panic-stricken about
himself, he is just cynical and flippant. He
doesn’t believe that goodness is worth trying for.
He laughs at all the principles which I was taught
to regard as elementary. He calls them ‘virtues
of the bourgeoisie’ and ‘old maids’ morality.’
When I protest, Oliver says my humor is ‘thin.’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</span>
Sometimes he says I am ‘devoid’ of humor. I am
not! <em>Am</em> I devoid of humor?”</p>

<p>“No, Cornelia,” I said. “But humor isn’t
your strong point. In your lighter vein, you incline
rather toward a gleeful gayety. Humor, in
Oliver, results from a skepticism regarding first
principles; and you are not skeptical about first
principles.”</p>

<p>“I am not, thank goodness. I do like to see
people gay and light-hearted and happy, and I
like to be that way myself. But I am light-hearted
and gay only because I am clear about what you
call ‘first principles.’ Life hasn’t any dignity,
any decorum, or justification, even, if one is constantly
questioning or mocking at everything
there is in it that is axiomatic. Oliver has no
axioms except derisive ones that he makes for himself.
To me, it isn’t endurable to be with people
who refuse to take serious things seriously. When
one jests at serious things, one not merely destroys
their seriousness, but one takes all the joy
out of the joyous and light-hearted things—all
the bloom from life.”</p>

<p>“I suspect,” I said, “there is a good deal of
truth in that.”</p>

<p>“And so,” she continued, “when this dreadful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</span>
accident happened on New Year’s Eve, I didn’t
expect <em>much</em> of Oliver; but I hoped, hoped, hoped
it might make him a little bit serious about the
children. It did nothing for him, nothing. All
he wanted was to put it out of his mind as quickly
as possible. Whenever I tried to talk with him
about anything serious—or anything sacred to
me—he simply wasn’t there.”</p>

<p>“Many men,” I said, “are shy about those
things, and feel more deeply than they can bear
to confess. Perhaps you don’t quite understand
Oliver.” I put in this plea, partly because I thought
it was true, and partly because I was curious to
know the depth of Cornelia’s disillusionment and
estrangement.</p>

<p>“Often and often I remembered, this spring,”
she replied evasively, “how my sweet old grandmother
used to talk to me, when I was a girl.
‘Marry a man, my dear,’ she would say, ‘who will
help you not to be afraid of death or anything that
can happen to you in this world.’ And then again
she would say, ‘Marry a man, my dear, who has
a sacred place in his own heart; and then everything
that is precious to you will be safe; and you
will not be alone in the great joys and the great
sorrows that life has in store for us all.’ And I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</span>
would ask, ‘Was grandfather like that?’ And the
dear old soul would draw in her breath and say:
‘Oh, <em>he</em> was high! He was <em>high</em>!’ with an accent of
adoration which made one feel that he must have
been a beautiful spirit. ‘I would have gone anywhere
with him,’ she always concluded when we
talked about him, ‘and I would have suffered anything
with him gladly, because we were together
in a place where nothing in this world could really
touch our companionship.’”</p>

<p>“That is very lovely,” I murmured. “That was
such a union as one reads about in old romances,
and dreams about, when one is young.”</p>

<p>“And so,” she continued, “when I was first
married, I hoped that it might be like that with us.
Oliver seemed to me then so strong and self-sufficient,
and his personality seemed so various
and flexible and so full of color and high spirits
and charm. I thought that, when I knew him
better, and had been taken into the innermost
intimacy, I should find there a still serene place,
such as my grandmother had described, with a
kind of mysterious joy and rapture at the heart
of it, because we should be united in loving together
everything that had been almost too lovely
and too sacred to speak of to anyone else. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</span>
is what I thought marriage was, the inner meaning
of it—and not a barren desolate place, full
of darkness and cynicism and the terror of death.
Do you understand, a little, why I felt so alone,
so helplessly alone early in the year? and why I
wanted to talk with you this summer, and why I
have just <em>had</em> to tell you these things to-night?”</p>

<p>She put out her hand toward mine; mine closed
over it.</p>

<p>“Cornelia,” I said, “I loved you twenty years
ago, and—in some ways I haven’t changed much
since. Have you?”</p>

<p>“Please—please don’t!” she said, gently
withdrawing her hand.</p>

<p>“And when the silence fell around us here, a
little while ago,” I continued, “and the meadowlark
sang in it, and then it was still again, didn’t
you feel, didn’t you know—Cornelia, tell me
what the silence said to you, when it grew too
intense, and you broke it.”</p>

<p>She lifted her head and seemed for a moment
to be following the flight of a sea gull winging into
the darkening West. Then she turned her cool
gray eyes upon mine, steadily, steadily, till their
flame burnt under my ribs and close about my
heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</span></p>

<p>“The silence said to me,” she replied, “that I
had been a very foolish woman—Isn’t it strange
how suddenly the color is leaving the sky! You
can almost see it fade while you watch it—like
the glow in an electric toaster, when you turn it
off.” She rose, as if talk were over, and we were
going home. I followed, bent on a continuation.</p>

<p>“Yes,” I said, “I suppose the sun over there
behind the cloud bank has just sunk under the
sea. You would think someone had pressed a
button. It reminds me of the <em>Ancient Mariner</em>—‘At
one stride, came the dark.’ But how have you
been a ‘foolish’ woman?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” said Cornelia, “we had better return
the long way, by the road. The dusk does come
fast, and I don’t like the short cut over the mesa
then. There are sometimes snakes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind snakes,” I replied: “they add a
spice. But if the way by the road is longer, I am
for the road.”</p>

CORNELIA’S RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE</h2>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">After we had started toward Santo Espiritu,
a delicate rosy afterglow succeeded the abrupt
gray interval, but our backs were now turned
upon it, and we only glanced at it now and then
over our shoulders.</p>

<p>“The silence said to me,” Cornelia resumed,
“that I had been a very foolish woman, because
I had expected of a human companionship an
intimacy of sympathy and understanding which
only a Divine companionship can give.”</p>

<p>“How do you know, Cornelia? How do you
know?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how it is with you—with men.
Maybe a man can fill his life so full of the things
he is doing—with work and ambition and the
improvement of the world—that he doesn’t have
to have an ‘inner life.’ For me, for most women,
there has to be an inner life. We live so much in
our personal relations; and I, at any rate, can’t
live my life unless I feel every day, all the time,
my relation to something that is peaceful and
beautiful and good, and that doesn’t change.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</span></p>

<p>“Have you really found it? Are you really
happy—Bluebird?”</p>

<p>“I like to have you call me Bluebird,” she said.
“I feel like one. I have never been so happy in my
life as in this last month, since I have learned to
keep the mood, the adorable mood, of the silence
here by the sea.”</p>

<p>“I guess,” I said, “I caught a bit of it—your
mood, to-night. But I know it won’t stay. It’s
a mood that I can’t count on. And I don’t have
it—often. Perhaps my setting isn’t right. At
any rate I don’t seem able to establish the relations
which you think are so important. So, with me,
the mood is a lovely fugitive.”</p>

<p>“I have it all the time,” said Cornelia eagerly,
“since I began to fill, really fill, my life with the
things I love, and to leave the rest out: walking
alone on the mesa; and being with the children;
and talking with my sister and Mr. Blakewell
(he’s really a most unusual young man); and going
to church in the dear little church here in
La Jolla. I always liked to go to church: it made
everything seem so certain and peaceful afterward—till
Oliver and the children began to argue.
And I liked religious music and the little choir
boys in white and the lovely procession of them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</span>
singing. It put me into a frame of mind that I
knew was right, because it harmonized perfectly
with all the things that I wanted to have in my
mind, and it shut the other things out.”</p>

<p>“When did this new mood begin?” I questioned.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t,” she said, “a very serious matter
with me till this last spring. Other things than
attending church had put me in the same frame
of mind. But after our trouble began and especially
after Oliver—went to Paris, and I felt
so desperately isolated, isolated inside, I mean,
I went to church very regularly, and I began
to attend early communion, and often to go
into the cathedral and sit for half an hour when
no one was there. And by and by the horrible
sense of isolation left me. Something came in
and filled up the vacancy. I couldn’t see just
why—nothing had changed; and in the first
month after he left, I hadn’t heard a word from
Oliver except by his postcards to the children,
but somehow I didn’t care whether I heard from
Oliver or not; and somehow I was growing happy,
positively happy, and clear and certain in my own
mind. The ‘mood’ stayed. I know why, now; and
now—you may think I am foolish, but now—I
have only to go into our little church and touch<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</span>
anything there, or just sit still alone in the dusk,
to feel ecstatically happy.”</p>

<p>“How do you explain it? I have never felt
ecstatically happy, in those circumstances.”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you,” she replied. “The children
want me to discuss it. I don’t want to discuss it.
The beautiful thing about it is that it doesn’t
have to be discussed. All I know is, that in this
fixed and blessed mood of mine I feel my life in
relation with what hasn’t changed and won’t
change; and if one can only keep one’s life there,
what actually becomes of one, in ordinary personal
relations, doesn’t matter, simply doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>“I felt that way once,” I said, “or something
like that. It was when I had ended a labor of ten
years, and had written the last page of my <em>Roman
Epigraphy</em>. I didn’t care for several days whether
I lived or died, after that. ‘All the best of me,’ I
said to myself, ‘is there, exempted from time, safe
in that book.’ But I found that I couldn’t get my
table companions at the University Club to take
that view. When it was published, not a soul of
them read a word of my ‘best.’ They seemed still
to prefer the worst of me, the mere empty shell
from which the oyster had been extracted—and
canned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</span></p>

<p>Cornelia looked at me gravely. “You are jesting,”
she said. “Please don’t. I am in earnest.
When I step into our little church, I say to myself,
‘Cornelia, what you really care for is safe
here. You don’t need to worry because other
people don’t agree with you, and don’t value
what you value.’ And then the final responsibility,
for everything, seems to slip so blissfully from my
shoulders, and to be accepted by a Power so much
stronger and surer than myself, that sometimes
I envy the white-cowled peaceful-faced women
who have gone into the Church and closed the
door behind them.”</p>

<p>“You would have to leave Dorothy and Oliver
behind you,” I said, “if you did that; and they
are worth saving, too. My dear Cornelia, I am
afraid this ‘blessed mood’ is a little dangerous to
you, and very dangerous to the rest of us. Don’t
wrap it too closely around you. I knew a woman
once who never gave her husband any occasion
for anxiety about any other man, but she fell so
much in love with her clothes that she became
inaccessible to him, and finally made him frantically
jealous—jealous of her necklace and of her
gowns.”</p>

<p>“Do you think I am really like that?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</span></p>

<p>“No, but that is a parable. You are becoming
very fond of Church clothes. You are so ‘dressy’
that you have become a little inaccessible to the
children, already—to their sympathies, I mean.
They are essentially so informal, you see. They
don’t understand you. I do understand you—somewhat.
And what I understand chills me a
little. I understand you to be on the verge of
losing heart over the problem of reconciling yourself
to the undistinguished mixture of life. Your son
would say that you have the ‘retreat-complex.’”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know what he would mean
by that. What do you mean by it?”</p>

<p>“I understand you to be on the point of making
a mystical surrender of your personality—on the
verge of lapsing into a beatific mood which will
separate you still farther from Oliver—and from
me, and will ensure you against the pain and bitterness
of reality. If you should surrender and really
become spiritual, like Father Blakewell, or saintly,
like no one of my acquaintance, you would drop
out and desert us. If you became saintly, which
Heaven forbid, your character would melt away
like a little cloud in the moonlight. Your charm for
me, for all of us, is in the definiteness of your
personality, the clearness and distinction of your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</span>
individuality. You are piquant and delightful
because you are a challenge, a whiff of the wind,
a counterblast. You have the ‘fighting edge.’”</p>

<p>Cornelia smiled as if she were recalling something
sweet. “I am a little tired just now,” she said, “of
fighting. There are pleasanter things than that.
I want to surrender and repent.”</p>

<p>“Repent of what?”</p>

<p>“Oh, of being worldly, you might call it.”</p>

<p>“Please postpone that till you are ninety. You
mustn’t repent yet. Do you know, I used to
think scornfully of deathbed repentances, but now
I think I was wrong; a deathbed is the place for
repentance; and the Catholic Church and the Gospels
are right in welcoming those who turn up at the
eleventh hour. In fact, I half suspect—if we were
put into the world to see what we can make of it,
and I don’t know any other good reason for our
presence here—I half suspect that God Himself
admires most those who ‘surrender’ to Him only
with their last breath.”</p>

<p>“How perfectly shocking!” exclaimed Cornelia.
“What can you mean by such absurdity?”</p>

<p>“By surrendering, I mean throwing yourself
on God before you have exhausted every possibility
of making sense out of the world for yourself.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</span>
Perhaps there will come a time for you and for
me when there will be wisdom in such a surrender.
But for young people, and for people at our time of
life, too, there is, there ought to be, something repugnant
in losing one’s intellectual grip, in letting
go, in abandoning the effort to find right relations
with realities, in giving up the attempt to make a
little cosmos out of the chaotic materials at hand.
To my mind, it is the unpardonable sin against the
Holy Ghost to desert that fine heartbreaking task
in order to take refuge in a mood of mystical ‘peace
without victory,’ peace without substance. Your
son would smile at my use of religious phraseology
and ‘mythological bunk.’ But he would understand,
I think,—with a little explanation, anyway,—precisely
what I mean by not surrendering
to God till the last breath.”</p>

<p>“The children’s ideas of religion at present,”
said Cornelia, “are simply heathenish. Will you
believe what Oliver said to Mr. Blakewell the
other day? He said something like this: ‘God?
What is God? God is a short word composed of
three sounds: a guttural, a vowel, and a dental!’”</p>

<p>“It’s true, isn’t it?” I ventured.</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know. But just imagine a boy
of nineteen saying a thing like that! No wonder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</span>
everyone is dismayed at the disappearance of
religion among the younger generation.”</p>

<p>“My dear Cornelia,” I replied, “religion itself,
as some one has said, is one of the most lovable
things in the world. The word sometimes becomes
obnoxious and is avoided by young people; the
thing itself doesn’t disappear. The word ‘God’
is a symbol for one of the great ideas in the world.
The word sometimes acquires obnoxious associations;
but young people do not lose interest in the
idea which it represents. God and religion are, and
always will be, popular, in the best sense, because
they come, offering to do for young and old what
old and young desire above everything else should
be done for them.”</p>

<p>“Well? What horrid paradox next?”</p>

<p>“Not a paradox at all. What everyone desires
most in the world is: to be taken seriously. That is
what I want, from you. That is what Oliver wants,
from his parents. That is what His Excellency
wants, perhaps from someone else. That is what
you wanted, I suppose, from His Excellency. But
none of us, apparently, is quite willing to perform
that great boon for any of the others. God
and religion take all men and every man seriously.
That is why they have such power of conferring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</span>
happiness that they could never fall into disrespect
if the guttural and vowel and dental which we
have just referred to did not, when uttered together,
often call into consciousness the obnoxious
things which we don’t believe in instead of the
desirable things which we do believe in.”</p>

<p>“I don’t quite understand you.”</p>

<p>“Why, I mean that at various times of life and at
various ages of the world people get together all the
things that they believe necessary and desirable,
and then they say that God, meaning all the beneficent
power anywhere in the universe, is interested
in preserving and forwarding those things.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and then what?”</p>

<p>“And then people acquire a fresh stock of information—about
geology and hygiene and economics
and slavery and intoxication and sovereignty
and war and Asiatics and international relations
and so forth. In consequence, they are forced
gradually to revise, in the light of their new information,
their lists of things which are necessary
and desirable. Your son Oliver is busy at just that
task now; and he needs a lot of help and
sympathy.”</p>

<p>“Oliver is really a dear boy,” said Cornelia,
“and I am helping him all I can. We are reading<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</span>
Newman; and I hope by and by to get him to
listen to a little of the <em>Imitation</em>, at breakfast.”</p>

<p>“You would do much better,” I said, “to read
with him John Morley’s <em>Compromise</em> or Santayana’s
<em>Poetry and Religion</em>. Nothing will so decisively
check, just now, the growth in him of a religious
sense as any attempt to persuade him that the
beneficent powers in the universe are pleased with
ascetic withdrawals from life, or that they countenance
authoritative limitations on the use of the
intelligence.”</p>

<p>“But isn’t Morley an atheist?” inquired
Cornelia.</p>

<p>I ignored the question, for it was growing dark
between the walls of the little valley, and we were
entering the deeper darkness of the trees on the
domain of Santo Espiritu.</p>

<p>“Oliver,” I said, “is reaching out into the real
world, into his own times, and gathering up here
and there, without very much high counsel, everything
that, as he puts it, sounds good to him. That
is going to be the substance of his religion; that
will be what he believes in. Whether this collection
of his beliefs will acquire for him the compulsion
and animating power, the ‘psychological
efficacy’ of the religions which possess a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</span>
history and a great poetry—that will depend on
his imagination and on his susceptibility to high
and noble emotions. At present he strikes me as a
fairly cool-tempered and slightly cocky young
positivist, unconscious that he is building an altar,
certainly expecting no fire from heaven to light his
sacrifice—rather disdainful, indeed, of all cults
which profess that they have come down out of the
skies.”</p>

<p>“But why, why,” cried Cornelia, “does he disdain
what comes down out of the skies? That, for
me, is the indispensable essence of religion. That
is what makes the difference between a house and a
church. Till it comes, there can be nothing sacramental.
And unless the sacramental element
enters, there is nothing really binding and obligatory
and final in all this miscellaneous collection of
beliefs. And everything gets so ‘messy’ and so
confused. And everyone picks and chooses, and
does just what he pleases. I don’t wish to pick and
choose—not about the really great things, I
mean; I want those things decided.”</p>

<p>We had been strolling slowly up through the
deep night of the walnut grove along the path
which ends at the gate in the walled garden. The
darkness, which had made us almost invisible, had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</span>
brought us physically nearer together. Cornelia
seldom takes anyone’s arm; she likes to be free
when she walks. But, in the obscurity, our swinging
hands occasionally brushed at our sides, with
an effect—a mutual effect, I believe—of merely
instinctive or “animal” sympathy, which, in me,
was instantly heightened into a kind of aching
tenderness. At the same time I was conscious that
our minds—what we call our minds—had been
moving at a widening distance. And now shafts of
light from the windows of Santo Espiritu cut
across the path, and as we neared the gate, we
stepped into the soft radiant glow of the place, and
the color in the bluebird gown lived again. We
hesitated, then stopped, and a momentary silence
fell on us once more. I pulled the crushed and
wilted heliotrope from my buttonhole, and inhaled
the faint fragrance, meant for my “time of day.”
Then I said, with my ultimate effort:—</p>

<p>“Cornelia, when one goes out at the church door,
one enters the universe. The only blessed mood
that I know comes when I feel that all the universe
is holy. And a sacrament, as I understand it,
makes not merely the difference between a house
and a church; it makes also the difference between
a house and a home. When the world is before one,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</span>
where to choose, as it is for every one of us since
Adam’s day, don’t we have to pick and choose—even
about the ‘really great things’? Like, for
example, how we are going to spend what remains,
at our time of life, of our poor little hungry human
lives?”</p>

<p>“No,” Cornelia replied. “No; for me, there is
no choice at all about those things. Everything is
perfectly clear to me now. I am going to spend
mine with Oliver. The reason why Oliver and I
rasped so upon one another last spring was that we
were too near together, with no point of contact
but our miserable nerves. I have been learning this
summer how to ‘carry on’ with Oliver. When we
are together again in the fall, I shall not live with
him, any more than I have for years. I shall live in
my blessed mood—in my secret garden. And I
shall be happy again, perfectly happy.”</p>

<p>“And I?”</p>

<p>“You are an old dear!” she said. “A very dear
old dear! Come now, let’s go in.” She seized my
hand gayly, like a child, and opened the gate, and
led me through the walled garden, damp with the
spraying fountain, into the bright colorful patio,
fragrant with the cedar-wood fire. The mah jongg
game was still in progress but Father Blakewell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</span>
and Cornelia’s sister relinquished their places and
withdrew. We played for an hour with the children.
Cornelia, who sat opposite me, drew all the
“honors” and “wooed” with hands full of seasons
and dragons, while I steadily failed to complete
my sequences and ended the evening with four
winds, one of each kind, on my hands.</p>

<p>When we broke up for the night, Cornelia unfolded
a plan for my assisting Mr. Blakewell with
tutoring the children several hours a day for the
next two weeks; and, as a matter of fact, we
adhered strictly to the programme.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>They gave me a cool bed in the guest-chamber,
with a couch, at my discretion, prepared on the flat
roof above, to which a staircase inside my room
gave access. I chose the bed on the roof. I lay
